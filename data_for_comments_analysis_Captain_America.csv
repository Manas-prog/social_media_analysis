Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Really missed out on an ""oh shit"" moment in theatres by revealing Red Hulk in the trailer. Shows that they really didn't believe in this and needed the hype to get butts in the seats.

Was it terrible? No? Kinda? Tons of expositional dialogue, a weird re-hashing of concepts/ideas they already did in Civil War (the main hero getting his buddy hurt in action like with Rhodes in Civil War, Captain America at odds with Ross but its different this time because he's president), and a general sense of a ""paint-by-numbers"" movie. 

It also kind of felt like it was trying to recognize the MCU *Hulk* movie the way *Deadpool and Wolverine* was showing love to the early Marvel movies.

The one redeeming factor to it, in my opinion, is that it felt less like a 2 hour preview for the next installment of the MCU like a lot of other movies post-Endgame, while still helping build the universe and touch on world changing events (""wHy iS No oNE taLkiNG AboUt a CeLeSTiaL cOmiNg oUt Of thE OceAn?!"").

Definitely could have waited for it to pop up on streaming.

EDIT: Also, how many fucking times are people going to shoot at Hulks before they realize its not going to do shit? Its such a dumb thing in a universe where a Hulk is not only not a new thing, they are recognizable enough for someone to quip ""I didnt know they can be red"".",JustHach,823

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Story wise, my main complaint is the movie makes it clear the ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù title deals with the discovery of adamantium, yet the movie does nothing to show what it can do and what makes it so special.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"I felt this was very bland, albeit inoffensively so. Its a conspiracy thriller whose core conspiracy is revealed on the fucking poster and trailer, rendering much of the film toothless and lacking momentum. It's hard to enjoy the twists and turns when the end result is so damn obvious.


The action itself is not great either, with some rough cutting, stilted choreography and CG overuse (with some scenes looking incredibly rushed and borderline PS3 cutscene).


As for the plotting, the first two thirds feel very close to Winter Soldier except unlike Steve, much of Sam's character development already wrapped up in the show making him a less engaging character to watch here, and the last third is a mix of... Incredibles 2's villain and the Red Hulk fight.


That said, Mackie, charming and fun. Esposito is rarely in it but makes an impression with the little he gets. Ramirez is a fun addition and I was happy to see Nelson back even if he looked a little goofy in the makeup. Lumbly is the dramatic highlight (Isaiah's scene talking with Sam in prison was powerful and easily the best in the film) and Harrison Ford is in pure ""point, grin smugly and assert yourself"" mode and is, as always, a delight.


But overall, this is a very forgettable film, and certainly not going to change the tides of the MCU's trajectory soon. Speaking of trajectory, that post credit scene was even more useless than the Red Hulk ""twist"". It would've been cool to hear that multiversal incursions are coming... if that wasn't the crux of the last 18 fucking MCU projects.¬†

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"This whole movie felt like nothing was happening the whole time.

We know from all the promos that Red Hulk is going to be the villain, yet the movie teases it like it‚Äôs some sort of mystery.

It had all the structure to lean heavily into the political thriller aspect of the film (literally had Harrison Ford at his best) but it gets too lost in worrying about the previous films. The empty platitudes were a bit rough in this one too.

Overall it was fine (being generous.) Red Hulk really shouldn't have been in trailers. Mackie deserves better, more focused material for the character.",Pigs-OnThe-Wing,785
Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"I just saw it. It's fine. Middle of the road. Clearly had production issues that they turned into a perfectly mediocre movie. There's really no reason for this movie to exist because it doesn't accomplish much of anything or drive anything forward narratively. Instead it mostly feels like stuff that's been done before in the MCU (even down to Cap v2/3, Hulk v2/3, Falcon v2, Widow v3...).

Random thoughts (that I will probably come back to as I think more):

- It feels like a Michael Bay movie except the action's not as good. So much lens flare and quick cuts where nothing breathes along with constant camera movement and location changes with constant driving music. Is there any camera shot that lasts more than 3 seconds? It almost felt like a Transformers flick in the worst ways.

- The action for that matter is pretty ho-hum. I can't think of anything that stood out other than maybe Cap surfing the missile.

- Apparently the sun is out in the eastern US at the same time as the Indian Ocean.

- It feels pretty sloppily written. One example: At one point the Leader just shows up at a location to kill one of the army guys just as that guy is about to tell Cap what's up with the pills. And then he leaves. 
It almost feels like they had already shot the scene with Cap asking his military pal to investigate and then forgot to plan a follow up scene so they came up with this last minute to wrap up the storyline. This is a guy who has also already been shown to be able to basically kill someone using airwaves, sooo wtf did he need to be there? I know we all like to rag on Batman showing up in Gotham in DKR (which I actually thought was fine) out of nowhere, but the Leader here just appears wherever he wants for a scene and then is off somewhere else.

- Mackie isn't great in these but I also think he probably got screwed by all the production problems on F&WS and this one. Also, I think ""stoic"" just isn't his thing and we already had someone as Cap who did stoic and earnest about as well as possible without being cheesy. Let Mackie be a little looser and he'd fit into the role better. Right now it seems like they just want him to portray the character as 85% of Evans' version instead of his own thing. Between his lukewarm character and production hell, it's hard to tell whether it's Mackie or Marvel or both that are off. Either way, as it currently stands, there's no way he should be utilized as an Avengers leader. Maybe that aspect would be a story point, and would be interesting, but I doubt Marvel goes that way. But he's not buyable. 

- He effectively is super-human too, with his totally not a Black Panther/Iron Man/Falcon suit. So, why are we acting like him not having powers is a problem? 

- New Falcon is ok but they went overboard making him a wiseass. It felt inauthentic. He and Mackie had a good rapport though. So, if they actually killed him off, it not only might've helped give some stakes; it might've been worth it since we essentially still have the Falcon as the lead and maybe give stronger motivation for FalCap to doubt himself. Plus, we don't need Falcon v2. Give us a new character because right now the MCU seems to primarily be made up of v2s or v3s of others.

- Isaiah Bradley was good. Probably my favorite character, but he's barely used. A more interesting movie would have overlapped Bradley's experience as Cap with FalCap's current experience. Maybe a mystery from Bradley's days where they could cut back and forth between timelines? That would be too interesting and new I guess. 

- Tiny woman was... whatever. Basically a nothing character. I could buy Pugh and Johannsen fighting military grunts. This woman was so, so small in stature and size that I couldn't buy her physically fighting anyone. It's just another lazy aspect of these movies - if she's a Widow, have her do some infiltrating or deception or just expertly use guns. Don't have her going toe to toe with grunts that are 3 times her size just because that's the easiest option. Even next to Pugh and ScarJo she would look miniscule. It's like they didn't even consider casting for what they want the character to be. It's a small example of how it seems like Marvel/Disney is too often putting the cart before the horse. 

- I wish they would have committed to the Serpent Society and used a bunch of them as henchmen instead of generic military grunts that we've seen so many times already. Give us more low-level villains like Crossbones and Batroc. Have Sidewinder look vaguely like his comic character. It costs little relatively and adds a lot. I'm so tired of grunts in military fatigues in these movies.

- Maybe it was my theater, but the mix sounded way off. I don't know if that's because of the choppy cutting or what, but there were a number of times where I felt like I missed the beginning of lines.",edicivo,222

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"This is the weakest supporting cast in a Marvel film to date. First of all, your lead is, although I like him, B-List replacement Cap. Then Harrison Ford recast. Knockoff Falcon, knockoff Widow with negative screen presence, castoff goofy villain from nearly 20 years ago, and Giancarlo Esposito doing the same thing he always does. 

Compare to the cast of Winter Soldier. Solid leading man in Chris Evans. Anthony Mackie as a great #2, Black Widow being played by an a-list star with charisma galore, cool villain with a great connection to the hero. Sam Jackson as a cool spy. Frank Grillo adding some grit.

One cast is just of much higher quality and more dynamic. This new captain America felt so flat and like a less-exciting retread of things we‚Äôve seen before.",Quasimodo27,72
Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"The issue is there is no real narrative hook to speak of. The closest we come is Ross who wants to be better for his daughter but we are barely shown that. The new Cap/Falcon relationship is incredibly bland even though I like both of them. The Isiah Bradley stuff was toothless, only lip service to the deeper implications of the character. 

And not to mention the whole first act is explaining to people who aren‚Äôt caught up with Marvel who everyone is and what their role is. You‚Äôre kneecapping your own movie when so much is just exposition for a potentially lost audience. It‚Äôs just unfortunate because there is clearly potential here. But they went the safest route possible. 

I feel like I‚Äôm being overly harsh though because I did enjoy it. It was fine. Middle of the road fun that adds very little but doesn‚Äôt damage anything or make anything worse. Mackie and Ford were great and Esposito seemed like he was relishing his role. Wild to think that three or so other versions of this movie exist.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],16/02/2025,"Yeah, the critics weren't kidding this was a safe movie. Thought it was just okay.  

- The exposition at the beginning recounting the events of the hulk movie, the reporter mentions that Betty Ross used to date Banner. Why would that ever be reported. Is this TMZ?
- In the first scene, Ross has bullet proof glass to his left and right but none in front of him. He walks past where the glass would be and waves. 
- Sterns has his medical degree hung up in his top secret lab? Then Cap like "" Well well well, it's Samuel Sterns"" like you only know that from this degree. 
- Torres uses the unlocked computer (?) at the lab. He tells Sam that Sterns is capturing these people's ""genetic DNA"" and Sam responds "" Don't make me look up words."" He's already dumbed it down for you.
- The car has a special spot in the hood for the shield. Wouldn't you want that near you at all times? 
- Why did the leader kill that general and his wife? Just to call the president or somehow talk to him through his headset? Then he turns himself in just to get a news story out there that he's been captured? 
- The movie mentions that Sterns had to take the fall from The Incredible Hulk but why... You couldn't point at the Abomination or the Hulk for that destruction? 
- I laughed when they quickly cut away from Ford being shirtless. They knew no one wanted to see that body. 
- The Bucky cameo didn't feel impactful when we saw Bucky during the Thunderbolts trailer an hour before.
- End credit scene like ""Did you know there are other universes?""  Marvel, you had a Dr Strange movie with that subtitle 3 years ago...
- Maybe it was just my theater but this was my first Dolby Cinema movie that looked terrible.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"So...it's more than a little disappointing. A big issue with the post endgame films/(some)shows is that nothing gets tied up, and it all feels like drip-feed, ""We super duper promise this will make sense/connect next time!"" Big spoilers ahead. TLDR; no character growth, no emotional through line, raises more than it answers questions presented, retreads old ground, and this film's quality calls in to question the year's upcoming films.

Sidewinder and Samuel Sterns come across as poorly re-used versions of villains we've met. Sidewinder is a recycled Batroc. Samuel Sterns is a lesser Zemo. Am I remembering incorrectly that Giancarlo Esposito dropped his accent after he spoke Spanish for the rest of the movie? Jangling the keys that he'll return to kill Sam.

The movie itself doesn't have an emotional through-line. The only thing I could track was Sam not feeling strong enough. It was weird, especially after seeing how the current serum's formula affected U.S. Agent in the Cap[Falcon]/Winter Soldier show. Is part of the show no longer canon/retconned? Why didn't Bucky argue the formula might not be the best option? Yes, it's established that serum reveals a person's innermost qualities, but they don't have the one that was used on Steve Rodgers.

The only set up and pay-off was with Joaqu√≠n Torres saying he won't die on his first mission and gets shot out of the sky over Celestial Island. What was Samuel Sterns' ultimate goal? Just to out President Ross? I'm fine with the references and more folding in of Ed Norton's movie, this, Shang Chi, and She-Hulk. But it feels slapped on when it's said he worked on secret government tech, when the only things shown were the pills and the lights/song sleeper agent activation. And for how big his brain is, he just...lets himself get caught at the hospital? Why didn't he call Sam like he did Ross?

A critique CinemaTherapy brings up with the live-action Avatar the Last Airbender show's Sokka is that they get rid of his sexism, robbing the growth he has when confronted. They say that a person in storytelling who starts off good and ends good has no arc or character development.

I feel that writing-wise this happens with Sam Wilson in this movie and in his show previously. There is no wrestling or conflict with Captain America's creed. He's right when his friend Isaiah isn't trying to kill the president. He's right to investigate where Samuel Sterns is being held. He doubts himself about not taking the serum, Bucky says his decision to refuse is the right choice. He's right, he's right, he's right. For all the faults that Iron Man 2+3, and this phase's Thor Love & Thunder have, they at least have impactful set ups and payoffs for their characters.

That post-credits scene was pretty frustrating, as this is now the third property with Loki and Ant-Man Quantumania where other worlds is teased.

I don't know what this movie is trying to do, or how it fits with the others. It made me less excited for the other two films that are coming out this year, and feels like nothing has strong connective tissue, from the overall phase's movie arc, to the character plots. This movie is just another added to the pile that makes me question why should I care about what's next.

EDIT: Also, the lighting in the final fight suffered from the same issue that the Black Widow movie finale, in and out of the Red Room.

EDIT2:Sterns felt paper thin and boring grandstanding. The events that he ""masterminded"" felt like convenient set pieces sprinting to the next scene. It didn't really clue the audience into what were Sterns' character or motivations. What did he lose out on? He taught collegiately, and used to be okay looking. That's what he's concerned with? That's all I could remember.

In stark relief, I can recall Zemo's motivations(dead Sokovian family), the scene weight of his presence, his coldness, the lengths he'll go to get to Bucky(drown a Hydra agent, kill a therapist/take his identity/knock out a power grid to remove cameras), his effect on all the characters and how that affected team dynamics or world beliefs, at each act and the ripple effects post-movie. 

I guess with what we previously had writing-wise I was hoping for more substantive writing. Something that built to a meaningful crescendo, that would be impactful within the movie and the implications of what occurred after. This movie just didn't leave me wondering or wanting more.",Tyraxion,129

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,I think I lowered my expectations so much that this movie didn‚Äôt bother me once it was all set and done. A solid 6 out of 10 movie if I ever seen one,CommunicationMain467,180
Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Kind of an, ""I'm not mad I'm just disappointed"" moment watching this movie. It's not, like, laughably bad like the Sony Marvel movies and it's not evil. It's just a big nothing. There are no great scenes, no interesting characters, no big wow moment, no further implications for the universe unless you count a man who wasn't President before the movie is no longer President. This just doesn't give you anything to latch on to. It's just filler content.

This movie is so worried about explaining the plot to you, because it's kind of gibberish, that it really forgets to do much else. It has that problem where the central marketing was based around Harrison is Red Hulk, and then the movie spends 80% of its runtime figuring that out and I'm bored out of my mind. Sure, it was cool to bring back Tim Blake Nelson, but his parts felt heavily reshot. He rarely interacts with the other characters, mostly through phone or speaker, and in the end he turns himself in. And I'm not fully convinced someone as smart as him couldn't have gotten that climax without turning himself in, nor am I convinced he ends the movie where he wants to be (in a smaller prison with less freedom) despite him putting himself there. Very sloppy.

I have nothing against Mackie, and rewatching Falcon and Winter Soldier before this was actually a more interesting rewatch than I anticipated. But Mackie just lacks juice when he's asked to lead a solo film. He bounces off Bucky well, but his new Falcon is no Bucky so this movie just feels stiff when it's trying to have fun with them. Not to mention F&WS wasn't perfect but it did brush up against the definition of terrorism and refugee sympathy and military control of Captain America even if it wasn't perfect. This movie was slated for post-election and is about a President who is out of control and being controlled by a genius, and yet this movie has nothing relevant to say. It's all so vague and Cap's last line to Ford is, ""If we can't see the good in each other then something something"" and I just don't think that's something most Americans want to hear right now.

Making this a lowkey sequel to The Hulk was interesting. Similar kind of nostalgia mining that D&W was doing, but not at all in a self aware way and that kind of makes all the difference. I was disappointed, I felt like they were building up to an ending where Liv Tyler shows up to calm down President Hulk, because that's like her thing and she's clearly what he cares about. And maybe that's not perfect either or too predictable, but what the movie opted for was a nothing burger. Sam had already mentioned Betty to the Hulk, but for some reason it works the second time and calms him down. They do bring Betty in before the credits for a nice scene where Harrison is earning his paycheck, but it screams to me that Tyler didn't want to be on set for more than a day or do too much heavy lifting.

Overall, I didn't hate it. It just didn't give me anything to work with, and the lack of anything interesting to say while claiming to be a political movie in this political climate is frustrating. . It ends with Sam saying he's ready to start the Avengers back up again and I kind of had a moment of realization that Endgame was 6 years and 12 movies ago and we are just now discussing a team. It's insane how slow this giant mechanical house of cards that is Marvel is moving right now, and the fact that this is what they've got in store for us is not promising. 4/10.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"A political thriller without the politics or the thrills, an Incredible Hulk sequel that‚Äôs afraid to call itself that, with Captain America shoehorned in for some reason.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"I like the movie overall, but it has some issues. First, I thought the Leader's motivation a bit convoluted, I get the revenge part, but the part when he almost incite a geopolitical war just because he wanted to make Ross ""Mad"" in front of public seems a bit ridiculous, personally I do not mind it, but I predict some people will say it is convoluted. Second, I think the fight with Red Hulk ended abruptly but, IMO, it is still in character for Sam Wilson, he's a former counselor, I get the reason why he moved the fight to the streets filled with cherry blossom trees, I think the movie just wanna show that Sam's has his approach to solve the problem.

There are many things that I like from the movie, Sam's bromance with Joaquin Torres is one of the highlights of the movie, every time I see both of them on screen, it made the movie more alive. The other highlights was Harisson Ford as Thadeus Ross, I felt like he filled the role seamlessly and his performance was so captivating, especially when he tried to control his anger on the ship. I know that Sidewinder (Giancarlo Esposito) is late addition, but he also one of the highlights of the movie, His fierceness on the second fight with Sam was pretty decent, it was entertaining when I saw that on screen. I also felt like the cameo appearances felt natural. Bucky Barnes visits to the hospital is nicely done, since Bucky, Sam, and Joaquin worked together on the events of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Liv Tyler appearance as Betty Ross is also appropriate when she visited her father on the Raft.

My Final words are, this movie reminds me of Iron Man 2, sure both of them had some issues, but at the end of the day I still like those movies and enjoyed them.",Sisiwakanamaru,50

I've said it before, I'll say it again: Anthony Mackie doesn't really have the charm to head one of these movies on his own. Even as a two-hander, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier was dull as dishwater. Did they barely even advance the plot at all here? It was supposed to be about creating a new Avengers team, but it seems like that all got sidetracked. 

Also, I'm getting really tired of every credit cookie teasing something else where they don't even bother to elaborate it to the audience. I don't even care at this point.

Captain America: Brave New World doesn‚Äôt do anything terribly brave or new, managing to land in the general area of ‚ÄúOkay, I Guess‚Äù when it really needed to serve as a solid foundation for the franchise moving forward.

The story initially leans more towards the relatively grounded tone of 2014‚Äôs The Winter Soldier, with a potentially interesting Manchurian Candidate sleeper agent plot that‚Äôs quickly discarded in favour of poorly explained mind control and clunky ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been manipulating you the whole time‚Äù villain schtick.

Director Julius Onah has done some great work in the past (Luce) and some paycheck work (The Cloverfield Paradox), but this seems to be another example of a studio having the major story beats and action scenes planned out well in advance, hiring a director to handle the scenes of humans talking in rooms later on in the production and affording them little to no control or creative freedom. The movie‚Äôs action scenes are mostly dull, there‚Äôs a jarring absence of internal logic or narrative momentum, and for the most part it kinda just washes over you until it ends.

Thankfully the cast elevates the movie ‚Äì Anthony Mackie is solid in the lead role, Harrison Ford actually seems to give a shit, and the supporting cast is quite strong (with special mention going to Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley, absolutely crushing every scene he‚Äôs in).

There's been several films and series now where it feels like they just completely hacked their projects to bits and stitched them back together in the editing room. Or the script and dialogue just isn't there. Like I just don't know what the fuck happened.",loomytime,7

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],16/02/2025,"I liked it at first while walking out of the theater, but the more I think about it, the less so I do. 

I'm not one of these imbeciles who was rooting for Marvel to fail from the very beginning, repeating idiotic slogans and canards like ""The MCU died with Endgame"", but it's a little hard to deny that since then, they've had a little bit of difficulty finding their footing with the main cast all being retired. Since the end of 2019, there have been some really terrific projects like Spider-Man: No Way Home and GOTG3 and WandaVision, and less good ones like Eternals, when in the past they pretty much had a perfect record with zero misses. Brave New World sadly falls into the latter category of being a miss for me. 

The movie is trying its best to follow the same conspiracy political thriller vibe that The Winter Soldier and Civil War both had, but the issue with this one is that the conspiracy this time is a little too muddled and buried in obscure MCU lore to care about, and more importantly, its oddly boring and humorless for long stretches of time. The trademark playful Marvel wit isn't there, which felt odd. The action is also not as dynamic and excited as the two Russo Brothers movies. It's fun, but kinda... generic feeling. 

I feel bad for saying all that because Anthony Mackie seems like a nice guy, and he's trying his best. I like Sam's story of him trying to find his own identity as a hero character independent of Steve Rogers, and I liked his sidekick. Just wish they had better material to work with. 

Harrison Ford is interesting as Thunderbolt Ross, because he's playing the character as more conflicted and less of a scumbag than William Hurt did. He's still a bad guy, and he is clearly meant to be an analogue of Trump, but the movie can't seem to decide whether he's actually a straight out villain who we should hate, or someone who we should have a degree empathy for. Ford's natural charisma and likability doesn't help matters.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Wasn't bad, wasn't great either, it just is. And because if this I wonder why did they feel the need to make this movie.¬†


Some quick thoughts:
- No progression for Sam Wilson's character and maybe I misread this point in the movie, but when President Ross tells him he is done and he leaves behind his white Captain America suit and goes with the blue one instead, it felt like he gave up the Cap role. Maybe it's just a nitpick of mine and I am misreading it, as the movie doesn't explicitly say he is no longer Cap, but what was the point in abandoning the white suit?¬†
- Even though Cap
¬†and the new Falcon have the ability to fly and they have those mini jet backpacks, originally the suit was supposed to be a paratrooper suit and while I can suspend some disbelief in the speed it can achieve, in this movie they are able to go over continents and oceans in maybe what feels like a couple of hours thus outpacing jets with big ass engines that can fly several times the speed of sound. They also have dogfights with jets at insane speeds and going through high G's numbers like it's nothing. So I feel the writers have forgot these are just guys in a suit and not Iron Man armor
- Awful cgi in the last battle between Cap and the Hulk with the last talk down moment being insanely cheap looking
- Cap gets stabbed by Gus Fring and he has no reaction to it in the moment, takes no time to recover and by the time they have the jet shootout over the ocean is as if these wounds never happened ( was he supposed to get the supersoldier serum but it got cut down during reshoots?)¬†
- Sabra - no super powers or superhuman strength in the movie, only Blackwidow training. But even though she is the size of a chihuahua she has no problem beating unconscious large numbers of goons in one sweep.¬†
- Could have used more Leader action and expand his role beyond just giving plot exposition. He felt menacing and even though he put in motion the plot of the nofie, felt underutilized and deserved a proper showdown in the end


I would rate this movie at the same level as Black Widow, but other than the introduction of Adamantium, there are no consequences or relevance for the MCU at large. And I doubt they will do anything with the Red Hulk in the near or medium future, which can be a problem considering Harrison Ford's age",Luca_Darc,24

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],15/02/2025,"It's clear that Mackie's Captain America, as hard as Marvel pushes it, will never be big $$$ successful and beloved by the fans like Chris Evan's take, and that's nothing against Anthony Mackie, but he's just not the guy for the role of Captain America. He should never have been groomed as Caps successor in the first place and I fear Marvel was afraid to introduce a new Cap fearing that people would perceive them as racist for not having faith in Mackie to carry the torch.

That decision though is whats making it impossible for Marvel to get out of their creative and narrative rut. You can't build a team around Mackie's Captain America sadly, and it exacerbates the key issue being that there's no Avengers, no one left with the charisma of the original cast who anyone is willing to believe will commit the next 7-10 years of their life for a Phase whatever we're in now.

Endgame should have been the end of phase 1, with GotG III serving as the epilogue into a 5 year break. Gunn already kind of achieved that feeling with his little carve-out of the MCU. But pause the whole thing and let suspense and anticipation build for what comes next.

I was ambivalent about Endgame because there was already a slate of 20 fucking more movies on the roadmap, so clearly whatever Thanos did wasn't that existential of a threat. The stakes are gone and the multiverse only makes that more apparent. No one cares.

Don't get me started on the decision to recast RDJ as Dr. Doom.

Overall, I enjoyed it for what its worth. I expected it to be a typical post End Game marvel movie, which is exactly what it was. The action, the attempts at comedy, the CGI, it was all there. Here are the issues I had with it. 

1) The big one is how it was marketed spoiling red hulk. Red Hulk was in almost every ad I saw for this movie. Hell, they were even selling Captain America cups and popcorn buckets with mini red hulks on top at the concession in the theatre. Now I don't have an issue with telling us red hulk is going to be in the movie, but I do have an issue with him being in it for like 10 minutes at the end of the movie. And trying to build the story around the red hulk being this big surprise when we all knew he was coming. The entire movie I kept wondering when he was going to show up. I was also a little confused because I wasn't sure if Ford knew he was the red hulk or not. Like he kept talking about changing and being a better person so to me it sounded like he must have had a red hulk incident at some point. 

2) The plot relied heavily on some concepts introduced in previous Marvel films. I have no issue with that in and of itself. For example, the mind control being triggered by a song, similar to how Bucky gets triggered by certain phrases. Or even the Mackie's new suit being made in Wakanda being able to absorb and redirect energy, like when he took down red hulk. My issue, is that if you're going to pull things from previous movies, you need to have faith in the audience that they will understand what is going on. It seems like they were worried some people may be lost and compensated with a ton of exposition. In my opinion, either lean into the previously established concepts and trust in your audience, or create some new concepts that don't require such exposition. I knew instantly when the music started playing and Isaiah when haywire, what was going on. It was dreadful to sit there and watch the characters slowly figure it out. It should have been IMMEDIATELY recognized as being very similar to Bucky's situation, especially considering during Civil War Bucky was all over the news.

3) I'm not a die hard comic fan, so I could be incorrect, but the idea of a non-super solider Captain America solo'ing a Hulk seems absurd to me. When's the last time a hulk won a fight? It's sad to me that the Hulk is so watered down in the MCU. I wanted to see him go on a rampage. I feel like we got a tease of it but it was too short. I just don't find Mackie's Cap beating a hulk by himself very believable.

4) Why was Liv Tyler not the one to calm down the Hulk? What was the point of even having her in the movie? Some fan service? Seemed like a massive missed opportunity. 

When I watch MCU movies these days I go into them imagining myself as if I were 10 years old watching the movie. With that perspective, I enjoyed it.",IknowNothing6942069,5

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],17/02/2025,"Outside of Harrison Ford, the acting was bad in this film. Anthony Mackie can't carry a film by himself and lacks the charm/charisma to hold the Captain America title. The actress who played the Widow character was unfortunately completely miscast - does anyone believe she, being maybe 110 pounds at most and 5 feet tall, would be able to take down a roomful of men herself, much less be able to adequately protect the President of the US from physical threats??? I won't blame the actress at all, but rather the casting director and Kevin Feige for that one. 

Also, the main plot point of some mad scientist being able to mind control others via lights flashing on phones and retro songs was never explained properly, not to mention one of the most stupid and unbelievable plot devices I've ever seen used in a film. It was completely unbelievable and just didn't fit at all with the supposedly somewhat realistic political drama genre Brave New World was leaning into, with the tensions between the US and Japan.

In terms of the positives, there weren't many: the aerial combat scenes were decent and the last fight scene with CGI Red Hulk was well done, though still not worth having to sit through a boring 90+ minutes prior to that payoff.

This movie is nowhere near being as bad as some people are saying, but it also never quite reaches full potential. ""Bad"", ""Average"",¬† and ""Good"" are all a spectrum of responses to this movie that I can take seriously. As I was using the restroom after the movie I overheard two groups of guys having an arguement. One group loved it and thought it was one of the best MCU movies. The other group kept comparing it to some of the worst comic book movies of all time. Both are crazy to me. I fall inbetween the Average and Good camps.


Pros:
The new Falcon is one of the better additions since Endgame. Really liked the character and his actor. Not once did I question his inclusion in the movie like I have with other new characters. Sam being a flying Captain America with vibranium wings makes for a pretty badass fighting style distinct from Steve. This might not have been ""the"" standout movie for Anthony's Captain America, but he feels right in the role. Has potential for the future. Harrison Ford also did really good as Thunderbolt Ross. I was very glad the the comedic moment were fun and happened at appropriate times. Hated some of the cringy jokes in other movies. The conflict over Celestial Island felt realistic. Of course the world governments would rush to claim it. Sam defeats Red Hulk in a sensible enough way.


Cons:
I think your average movie goer should absolutely watch The Incredible Hulk before seeing this. Much confusion otherwise. Certain scenes were clearly shot before a green screen and they are a bit distracting. The former Widow felt pointless to the movie and distractingly didn't look like a believable badass. Movie feels safe. There is opportunity to take risks or make a statement and it feels afraid to go there. Don't stay for the end credit scene. Huge waste of time.",TwoBladesOneBow,29

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"On paper, the plot is solid. On screen, it‚Äôs clear it was let down by a bad storyteller. Way overly muddled with no clear stakes or tension. 

Mackie delivered as Cap, and Ford delivered as Ross. Calming the Hulk down should‚Äôve been a Betty thing, and his daughter had been mentioned so much that it was kinda weird it *wasn‚Äôt* her. I did enjoy Cap having his ass handed to him by Hulk though - he unloaded everything he had, and it still looked like he was going to get one punch killed before talking Red Hulk down. Hulk‚Äôs attacks felt claustrophobic and relentless. 

I don‚Äôt agree there isn‚Äôt anything brave about this film though - it features a minority as Captain America. That will be far too much for some judging by the goings on in parts of the world atm. But on that point at least, Mackie / the movie delivers. Enjoyed Sam more when he was dealing with his limitations and finding novel ways around things, rather than leaning on: ‚ÄòSam used a speech, it was very effective!‚Äô

The missile surfing was memorable, but it happened so quickly! Blink and you‚Äôll miss it stuff. The movie needed to breathe but was too laser focused on overly explaining what is ultimately a fairly simple plot. 

Lovely cameo from >!Bucky!<. Great wingman in Torres. Solid villain in Sterns. 

Isiah was way underserved, and it‚Äôs clear that the showrunner for Falcon & The Winter Soldier thought he could assume people knew who he was. Lots of ‚Äòtell, don‚Äôt show.‚Äô

Giancarlo stole every scene he was in, but it was disappointing he wasn't the main villain in the end. Adamantium is officially part of the MCU now. 

The problem is the film is just way too safe. It wants to evoke the Winter Soldier film but doesn't have the guts to do anything as daring as that film did.

* I've an unpopular opinion in that I really like Anthony Mackie as Captain America and he has a great presence on screen. I think he was set up with a boring script and godawful writing but he still feels compelling.
* The Captain America costume may be my favorite in the MCU. The wings/shield combo is so sick and I love how the suit is used in fight scenes.
* Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley was incredible (although I don't think his story would carry as much weight if you hadn't seen the Disney+ series)
* For some reason the over-the-top use of cherry blossoms in every scene kind of worked for me. I liked the settings.
* Some of the fighting actually felt like it had stakes. Like >!red hulk ripping the wing off Sam felt scary for one second before they resolved everything!<

**Dislikes**

* Movie was long and dull. I haven't been out much lately and I was still like when is this going to be over?
* Some incredibly bad CGI. I could not believe some of this made it into the movie.
* Too many closeups? At times I couldn't tell if people were in the same room as each other.
* I liked the idea of Sabra's character but her fight scene took me out of it. How is she flipping these guys over? I wish they gave her more realistic skills like I kept comparing her to Violet Sorrengail from Fourth Wing. I love the idea of underrepresented fighters but the fighting still has to make sense!
* I AM SO TIRED of the trope of MCU movies having an emotional moment and then IMMEDIATELY cutting to jokes. At this point it's like nails on chalkboard for me. The Sam and Bucky scene almost sent me into a rage. It just feels disrespectful to the audience and very cynical.
* Sterns as a villain made no sense. Couldn't understand his character motivation / he never felt menacing or impactful. The villain from Kraven was more compelling.
* Giancarlo Esposito felt like someone doing an imitation of Giancarlo Esposito.
* Some godawful writing (How is something ""more indestructible"" than something that's indestructible? Why did Joaquin say something like ""DNA code"" or something fake and Sam says ""don't make me look up big words?????"")
* The political intrigue was mostly confusing and just boring. The political messaging (""we all just need to listen to each other and see the good in each other"" felt like a lot of bullshit in today's America.

And I don't mean there's never been reason to sympathize with Ross, in fact audiences quite like getting unexpected/new sides to previously unsympathetic characters. Rather, Ross hasn't even been a guy that viewers love to hate previously. He was a secondary antagonist in *The Incredible Hulk*, which released in 2008 to a general lack of enthusiasm, then he was gone for the better part of a decade before popping up a few times in movies people liked a lot more but where he was at best a tertiary figure. Even before the recasting (which obviously couldn't be helped, in the light of the death of William Hurt), there's just no there there. He was not a real character.

It's not impossible to build a resonant film on weak prior foundations. An obvious recent case would be *No Time to Die*, which performed a remarkably effective salvage job on characters from *Spectre* that almost nobody had cared about. And the whole *Creed* franchise was built on a lot of stupid/cheesy stuff from *Rocky IV*. But you're embarking on a tough task, and *Brave New World* never really gets to selling us on the finale of a character journey we never previously saw.

Also, Bucky is running for Congress? What?",sean_psc,8

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],18/02/2025,"I won't say that this is the worst movie in the MCU because it's not, but it is certainly in the bottom tier.

**The good**
* They finally address what's going on with the celestial that should have completely submerged several countries in water due to sea level rise.
* I can't fault the CGI. I was never taken out of the movie because of stuff looking terrible.
* Harrison Ford was doing more acting-wise than I've seen out of him in a while. (I haven't seen Shrinking, which I've heard is good)
* Anthony Mackie did well with the limited material that he was given.

**The Bad**
* I rolled my eyes a bunch of times on the amount of access given to people under the circumstances of a multi-head-of-state assassination attempt. How does Sam just force himself into the Presidential bunker?
* When Sabra gets Isaiah (who is a SUPER SOLDIER by the way) out of his cell, how are they just walking and talking along with a single guard while he says he's ""not going to jail""? That man could break that woman in half without effort. It's insanity.
* Speaking of Sabra, the question I asked in another comment was this: How does an Israeli-born Red Room-trained ex-Widow become the President's head of security?????
* The fact that they're using France, India and Japan as the counterpower to the USA because the studio doesn't have any courage. How does it make sense for Japan, being thousands of miles away from the INDIAN Ocean, to somehow lay claim to all that adamantium and be able to move a fleet into the area?
* Post-Indian Ocean confrontation, they move Joaquin who is in critical condition from, again, the INDIAN Ocean all the way to Walter Reed.
* The labeling on stuff to ""show rather than tell"" such as the US Navy Training Facility sign on a shed.
* The absolute refusal and hand-waving for Sam not taking the super solder serum.¬†¬†
* On a similar note, why, after establishing Sam using the vibranium at the beginning, does he wait until the moment of death to finally use it against Red Hulk? His other weapons are basically useless
* The fact that both Sebastian Stan and Liv Tyler were seemingly hired for one day of shooting and had literally no impact on the plot.
* The end credits scene was nothing.

Anyway, I could go on, but I choose not to. There's no reason to watch this movie again and it likely won't have a ton of influence on future movies, which is I guess to its credit. Just skip to the Fantastic Four and the X-Men like you should have done years ago. This is ridiculous.",SleepyFarts,6

Many aspects about this movie plays things safe with a dull narrative, uninteresting characters and a lacking of substance. The performances weren't great and having the political themes blended with the narrative, while it can be interesting, unfortunately doesn't work at all and feels messy.


MCU has pretty much just fallen into the territory of a big corporate mess.

1) I don't understand Sam's suit. He's able to fly at Mach 1000 and crash into the ground perfectly fine but then some chump slashes his entire torso open. Is he full vibranium or not?

3) Congressman Bucky?? What did I miss? He was moping around in FATWS, then he's in a thunderbolts trailer, then suddenly he's here in a suit ready to become an elected official? What?

4) This villain just teleporting around randomly. Shows up at a random navy training facility and EMPs a guys heart and then vanishes again.

5) As much as I hate to say it, give Sam a nano suit. He's not a super soldier... that suit is his power. That entire secret prison scene needed his whole set up. Walking in with just a shield is so stupid.

6) A carrier strike group WITH THE PRESIDENT on board is absolutely not going to let rogue fighters or hostile enemy fighters anywhere close to shooting missiles at their ship lmao.

7) Sam's secret service friend that is randomly the presidents bff was awful. It was like she was just reading her lines.

8) That whole scene with bucky felt weird. Was it suppose to be a little recap of the emotional side of FATWS for people that didn't watch it? When he said cap made a mistake I was thinking to myself ""didn't we already go through all this?""",zapdude0,7

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],18/02/2025,"This movie is an absolute travesty. It takes so many cool concepts and ideas and either ruins them or just outright butchers them and the source material. Sabra is an excellent and cool character in the comics. She's a mutant and a spy at that, but you get none of that here other than a quick (ADR?) out of place line that she's a red room flunkie or something. Shira Haas is a superb actress but they didn't give her anything to work with here and even filmed her in such a manner that isn't complimentary. They really did not show her good side and the only person I can blame for that is the director. You could have written her out completely and wouldn't have changed the movie. Also, I hate the alterations they made to her to appeal to an incessantly vocal online group that doesn't care about the character or the comics one iota. If you're going to do Sabra, then full blown do Sabra and stop with this mixed messages and pussy footing around. I found falcon 2 to be trying (both in terms of character and the actor playing him) but ultimately annoying. Harrison Ford is trying his damn hardest but he's just not right to take over the role. Sam Elliott would've been a better and more inspiring casting choice.

The idea of a scramble for the celestial and its metal is intriguing but they didn't play it right or have enough to do with it and its build up. The movie has some of the jankiest flow I've ever seen, especially for a marvel movie. Some of the action looks cheap, like some of those B level and below 90s action flicks. That whole secret base set up is reminiscent of other movies in this series, but just done poorly and the drop in quality and craftsmanship is more than apparent.  I mean, a secret base with flickering lights? What, could nobody fix the electrical or replace some bulbs? That whole sequence completely took me out of my immersion in the film. The make up looked like shit throughout. I love Tim Blake Nelson, but they did him dirty in this film. The hell was that makeup or prosthetics? That's the look they decided upon for The Leader? Why not more comics accurate or something that doesn't look like one of the zombies from Last of Us? The Leader is such a great character with an amazing power set (and background/ story) that compliments the brute/ physicality that is the Hulk, but once again, they completely butchered the character. This movie somehow looks worse than MCU movies from 15-20 years ago. Thor: the Dark World was a low point, but Marvel can't even aspire for the levels of that movie anymore. There's just no consistency anymore at marvel. This movie feels like it should've been/was a Hulk movie that got botched into somehow being a captain America/ falcon movie but just done so poorly. The Red Hulk storyline is one of the best in the comics and all they did was barely give it lip service and definitely didn't do it justice. 

I don't even mind Cap America Falcon or Anthony Mackie, but he seems out of place in his own movie and they really don't help him out with some of the lines they give him. I just can't tell if there was too many cooks in the kitchen on this movie or if the cooks are just incompetent.  What a blunder. What an unforced error by Marvel/Disney/ MCU.

Edit: there's so much character assassination in this movie that I wish I hadn't seen it. Fucked up on The Leader. Fucked up Red Hulk. Fucked up Sabra. The whole movie is just another complete fuck up and waste of your time. Remember when marvel actually respected its fans? Rehire that guy. Bring back Perlmutter or whoever the guy that actually cared not to fuck up the characters and storylines. Feige might be cooked. Success might've gotten to his head.",Hiccup,6

New Falcon and new Widow are jokes of characters- literally, who are they? They have no character arcs or backstory or emotions to speak of. They're there to fill a roster in a way almost no MCU characters have been

After fifteen years of movies about Steve Rogers' complicated feelings on being government propaganda, THIS is where we've ended up? With Sam Wilson serving the military again, and Bucky Barnes running for senate? Who would vote for that guy? There's videos of him killing people!!!

It's weird how one little scene of Bucky actually made me mad. His arc in FatWS was so good- seeing him quietly becoming a better person. Why would he of all people want to become a politician? He's like a century old and he's been brainwashed and fighting the whole time, he should be on a farm somewhere like Hawkeye chilling

I liked the serious tone and Sam‚Äôs arc following from F&TWS as he still tries to prove to himself that he‚Äôs earned the Shield was still solid. I liked how they showcased Sam‚Äôs use of tech, agility and empathy to overcome his physical shortcomings compared to Steve

But it does feel like a politically charged film that‚Äôs too afraid to be political. It goes more neutral ground and comes off as neutered instead. That lack of anything substantial to offer - like the Hydra twist in Winter Soldier - is probably the reason why Sterns master plan and the big third act reveal has been the Big Red Selling Point of the fucking marketing.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],15/02/2025,"While I didn't hate as much as some others did, I sure didn't enjoy it. The decision to give away the Red Hulk reveal in the trailer is baffling. The whole movie is building towards it, but there's no suspense for the audience and the impact of the transformation is squashed. Samuel Sterns is possibly my least favorite MCU villain ever--I hated the visual design of the character which felt so out of place for the tone of the movie. The story is disjointed and chopped to death. Ruth serves no purpose in the film; they could remove her entirely and it wouldn't impact anything. 

I thought Ford was very good in the first two acts, and I enjoyed the enthusiasm and earnestness that Danny Ramirez brought to Torres. And while there was plenty dialogue too clunky for even the best actor to salvage, I did think Mackie was pretty great. He was excellent in some of the quieter, more emotional scenes: at the hospital with Bucky and especially at the end with Torres.

I liked the serious, political thriller type of tone, and the beginning of the movie was pulling me in. Contrary to some other comments, I liked the pervasive score, I thought it was adding to the intensity toward the beginning of the movie, and I thought the intrigue build up was done pretty well. However, you can definitely tell that all of the Giancarlo Esposito sections are reshoots, because he's in the movie for what feels like five minutes, which is a shame. I really thought he was going to be the main villain based on the trailers, and I was getting excited during that sequence where he tries to kill Cap by blowing up his car. But then he gets captured, thrown in jail, and then he's out of the movie! I was really disappointed by that. The real villain reveal was underwhelming to the extreme in my opinion, he had nowhere near the charisma or menace of Giancarlo. But, I still had some fun with the movie. The action was nothing innovative, but it was fun to watch. The Red Hulk fight I absolutely loved, and I thought it was worth the price of admission. This wasn't the tight, intense, grounded political thriller the trailer made it seem like it was going to be, but it was entertaining enough to warrant a night out at the movies. I'd probably give this a 6 or 7, and I want to watch it again to finalize my thoughts on it.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Before watching this I was perplexed as to why they would make a sequel to The Incredible Hulk that doesn't feature the Incredible Hulk

After watching this, I'm even more confused as to why this wasn't a Hulk movie. Everything involving Ross and The Leader is clearly from some lost Incredible Hulk 2 draft but they shoehorned in Sam Wilson instead of Bruce Banner. This makes the whole movie fall apart as Sam Wilson doesn't have personal relationships with General Ross, Betty Ross, or The Leader. There's no reason to care! Where's The Hulk? She-Hulk at least? Fuck, I'd even take Skarr!

I like Anthony Mackie but Sam Wilson was always designed to be a supporting character and that's pretty evident in this movie. The dude is likeable, charismatic, and I often find myself rooting for him in his movies but I don't think he's a leading man. Or he at least needs someone to play off, like Bucky (who shows up and just...decides not to help?)

Didn't really care for the new characters. Something about Falcon II comes off as fake to me and I'd have rather they just had Bucky be his sidekick again. The Leader seemed like an afterthought and was really disappointing in both his design and his writing after a 17 year wait.

Don't know what the point of Sabra, the 12-year old Black Widow lady was but [boy do I remember reading the comic with her as a kid and I can't believe they tried to adapt her!](https://preview.redd.it/relevant-to-current-events-with-sabra-my-favourite-mutant-v0-muwsk1pcs1ub1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=0bc34dd1b03c366c8bdc8f564ca84a382cd072f6) If they dropped Sam into the middle of the Isreal/Palestine war like Hulk in that issue it honestly would have been a more interesting movie.

Solid 7/10 for me, but I have always liked Sam and Mackie a lot.

Dialogue was trash in many spots. Just dumb exposition

Some plot points seemed like a redo of Winter Soldier, but weaker yet still felt good.  The secret lab, the spy stuff. All that was done ok.

The action was also good and the CG was also good in most scenes. The intro scene Sam fight looked weird and some of the last Hulk fight looked weird but overall great.

I even thought I'd hate Sam not having the serum, but that scene with Bucky was well done. Even then he joked about it.

I think the movie suffers from being too safe, but only because I think one of the Banners/Hulks and Amadeus Cho should've been here. This should've been more Hulk wars, but I also think it introduced things that moves the MCU forward more than recent movies. Oh and they finally acknowledged the Celestial. That scene was cool action.

CABNW felt like it was literally written by AI. middle of the road bs. Characterizations had no gravity. Didn't care at all about red hulk. Casting was terrible as well as the acting.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],23/02/2025,"Saw it today and this is the first movie i've ever walked out of.

It's shit. The way it's shot, it reeks of the actors not being there for their scenes. The CGI is too obvious and feels like a run of the mill set piece. Admittly, I haven't kept up with the shows because there's something like 20-30 different marvel shows or feels like it.

Giancarlo is wasted but he puts all of his effort into what screen time he has. 

The plot had potential but I was half expecting Ross to be revealed as behind his own assassination attempt so he could justify grabbing more power, bypass the senate etc... THe mind control aspect is wonky. And the sudden reveal of Issaiah being a captain america, that felt like it was suddenly put in.

Also, if Sam is meant to be a normal human, he takes a crap ton of abuse that should have at least, put him out of action. The suit? It's a suit. Ironman's armour always sounded like it was metal that was being attacked. Every dent looked and felt like the armour was doing it's job of keeping Tony safe. Captain America's suit? Looks like you could pierce it with a normal knife. 

Red Hulk was disappointing. I kept expecting Hulk to turn up to put him down. Hell, Sam failing to even do much against Red Hulk would have been perfect for him to realise, if he wants to be Captain America and deal with Hulk level threats, he needs to get stronger, faster, more durable etc... 

Instead, it was meh. Adminatum being discovered, just now is a bit of a weak reason for them to introduce Wolverine down the line.

Even Rise of Skywalker, I stayed to the end and I left the cinema feeling confused, baffled and let down.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"I'm definitely in the minority so far it seems. 

I enjoyed this film. It felt grounded. It gave us some development of the Celestial in the ocean. Mackie and Ford are great performances I feel. Esposito had gravitas and I hope he becomes Mackie's recurring villain as he forms the full Serpent Society. The new Falcon was also likable. 

Yeah the trailer showed Red Hulk, which is a big twist, but I Found the twist of beating him and handling him more interesting. We knew it was coming the entire time, so seeing this secret was fun. I had no idea Leader was in it, which was super cool because he looked so crazy. 

To me it didn't feel like there even was a *villain*, just antagonists. Ross wasn't wrong. Leader was doing bad things but I understood *why*. Serpent was a little lackluster, but he became an interesting third player. 

Yeah it was safe, but honestly...I wanted something safe post Endgame. Don't gotta have massive implications of the greater world at all for every movie. Sometimes I just want to see how a character handles a problem. This movie, in the end, felt like it could've fit right in with the Endgame Saga. 

Post Credit scene was alright. I kept joking with my girlfriend about ""running the probabilities"" because that's such a dorky power.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Thought the movie was alright. The action is quite good, Anthony Mackie, Harrison Ford, Giancarlo Esposito, Carl Lumbly, and Tim Blake Nelson all do well with what they have but what's holding this movie back is they don't have much.

The script and the plot is going for thriller, they're going for a tragic villain in one place and a devious mastermind in another, but the development and overall engagement is just totally missing from this movie. It feels like it doesn't really have something to say which is not what has been the case with the Captain America franchise thus far. I think they could've made a better movie out of cutting down the Captain America and the Winter Soldier show and looked into building that into this as a sequel.

It's also a *bit* awkward that parts of this film are a sequel to 17-year old The Incredible Hulk and it really expects you to remember what was going on in that movie as well as any little beats that were mentioned with General/President Ross in other films who is now played by Harrison Ford. The movie also plays the entire Red Hulk plotline as if it is a mysterious plot twist despite the character being in the trailers from the start. It's odd. I don't really know how else to describe it.

Overall it's a fine watch that isn't really rewatchable but delivers in a few action scenes at the start and the end. Cap vs Red Hulk was a great, exciting bout that really reminded me Marvel knows how to do Hulk stuff in peak form when they want to, but what's lacking in the film is really just meaning and reason to care for the characters. I also think the supporting heroes were quite weak. New Falcon is okay but feels like he's trying to be too cool at times, but the character who seems like a red herring villain that joins the team later I didn't care for at all and they were also made to seem kind of incompetent and dumb despite the backstory suggesting legitimacy. At one point the character is watching two murders and a suicide without DOING ANYTHING AT ALL. I thought I was losing my mind.",Uncanny_Doom,2

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"After last year's Deadpool And Wolverine - I really thought we were back to the good old days of Marvel, but after this, all the hopes I had were crushed! The story has some fun action scenes but is as thin as you can get, and even though it is one of the shortest MCU movies, it has many very boring parts. 

Except for Anthony Mackie the actors were also not too great, and the only one who seems to be enjoying his time on set is Harrison Ford. It is a real shame that they are throwing so many cool Marvel characters like Red Hulk, Sidewinder, The Leader,‚Ä¶ into the mix without really doing anything meaningful with them! 

There is also never a real threat for the Captain to fight, and when they get close to it at the end, they solve it in a quick and lame way, which means that Sam Wilson did not get a chance to prove he is worthy of the shield once again. 

But the absolute worst thing about the movie was the CGI and effects. I don‚Äôt have a problem with some minor mistakes, but this is just on an amateur level! In the end, this movie added absolutely nothing important to the MCU, except for maybe one line, and it is the most skippable one of them all.

My only problem in the movie was that the President wasn't very President like, the most important person in the world moved around with virtually no team (apart from the assistant) that he communicated with, and he seemed to be easily distressed for someone who would be in a political position for a long time.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],16/02/2025,"I really wanted to like this. It started promisingly enough with the interesting history of Isiah Bradley as the 'Forgotten Captain' and a sort of twisted version of the US Government's own Winter Soldier made to do their dirty work, plus the chemistry between Cap and New Falcon was genuinely good.

But the whole movie falls down once we get to the meat and bones (or rather, skeleton) of the plot: I imagined that Ross would be set up as the main villain: a President who, striving to ""defend America in a (Brave New) World of chaos"" from all the superpowered villains, Gods and aliens running around the MCU, resorts to increasingly ethically questionable practices which rankles with Cap - setting the stage for a stark philosophical battle between the President of the United States as the people's leader and Captain America who is supposed to embody the best of the American people's ideals. Moreover, given how the government was completely infiltrated by HYDRA and the previous Captain America was driven into exile, Sam would be well within his right to be concerned with Ross' actions.

But instead of a political thriller befitting the title of 'Brave New World', we essentially get a semi-sequel to the 2008 Hulk film, but with a differently-coloured Hulk. It turns out the big bad villain isn't Ross or even the Serpent Society with Giancarlo Esposito again typecast as 'Evil Acting Big Bad Boss' - instead it's this Doctor nobody remembers who was screwed over by Ross in the canonical backstory of a film from more than 16 years ago which nobody remembers? Why?

Despite what some think, I actually like Mackie as Cap. He brings his own style which every iteration of Captain America should do. Yet he's been done so badly by Marvel's complete inability to give him a script which isn't yet another tired rehash of 'You're not Steve Rodgers, you're not Cap' which I thought was supposed to have been tackled and sorted in Falcon & the Winter Soldier?

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],16/02/2025,"plenty of issues and I don‚Äôt think this is great, but I feel like any of my points have been said already lol.

Going a different route‚Ä¶ I think this just kinda highlights some glaring issues post-Endgame in the sense that personally, I feel like this should‚Äôve been one of **the first** movies after Endgame. 

You can obviously play around with the other movies if you need Eternals to come out beforehand (doesn‚Äôt really matter much), but since most of the building to this movie happens off-screen, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd matter. Release TFATWS in 2021 and then drop this shortly after, so that years earlier into **THE MULTIVERSE SAGA** we have Sam restarting The Avengers AND the ominous tease from Sterns about Secret Wars. 

You can then have some of these other post-credit scenes make more sense too! Like Shang-Chi can meet with the early shapings of a New Avengers lineup, assuming Young Avengers just doesn‚Äôt happen because they‚Äôre barely moving that along, Kate & Yelena could just get recruited at the end of The Marvels. 

Instead, we have the next Avengers movie out next year with the only movies beforehand being Thunderbolts (probably will have a post credit scene with Mackie & Stan taking Avengers stuff), and Fantastic Four, which I cannot see having any further build for the Avengers lineup lol. 

It‚Äôs just really annoying when you look back at The Infinity Saga and can see how genuinely well-built everything was. There were some loose ends (ironically Samuel Sterns being one of them) but every movie felt like it had a purpose either in introducing new key characters or pushing along the overarching story.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],19/02/2025,"Really has the Star Wars prequel issue of having a world with genuinely compelling politics but not sticking the landing on exploring how interesting they are.  The desperate pivot that world leaders (Ross especially) must have had to do after the superheroes they outlawed saved the universe is fascinating, and you can see that in little hints in the rest of the franchise like slapping the shield on the Statue of Liberty, making a musical off of the MCU equivalent of 9/11, trying to hype Captain America up again as a symbol of the government, and Ross' attempt to bring back the Avengers in this.  But it never gets deeper than that in this film, and despite all the time we spend with Ross (who ultimately has the more compelling plotline) we never get too far beyond those nods.

I get that this was probably cut up really bad between five different writers and reshoots but how did no one in the editing and test screening process say anything about Sam taking time in the penultimate scene to explain the gamma pills again to both the audience who had already heard it and a guy that definitely already understood what happened?  Another weird moment was Ross saying ""If I ordered the theft of the adamantium why did I send Captain America to get it back"" like that wasn't exactly what he was being accused of.

Also maybe this was just my theater but there were little glitches across the screen at a couple of moments related to Leader's mind control and it looked like the exact same flashing geometric effect that had shown up in the trailers and the opening credits, so I thought it was leading somewhere, but it never showed up again.  Maybe it was just a technical glitch but it was a weird coincidence.

The leader for some reason gave himself when that wasnt really needed. The choreography and cgi of the final fight felt weird.

The story was just a really strange one. It was basically a sequel to the Hulk movie pretending to be a Captain America movie? I think that's the biggest crime committed here - they went so generic with Captain America that they didn't even really give him any kind of meaningful personal development and instead had to lean hard on a plot that was, again, *a sequel to a 17-year old Hulk movie that nobody liked and didn't even feature the actor who played Bruce Banner in the rest of the MCU filmography*.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"It was pretty middling.  I think there was definitely a good story here, but they seemed to shy away from it.  The trailers should not have revealed the Red Hulk twist, and he should have fully transitioned during the war at sea sequence.  It would have been a killer moment to see him going to town on battleships and jets with the backdrop of the petrified celestial.  

Then after that there could be some confusion and uncertainty around who/what Red Hulk is, as they accuse the President who perhaps denies it and struggles with hiding/controlling it for a bit before it being proved it's him and then the country and Sam can reckon with what to do about a President who is a literal monster....which could eventually lead to the ending cherry blossom scene.

I liked the island air fight scene a lot it was exciting with good CGI.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"When I saw the real ease date in the trailer, I was wondering if it was placed there because February is typically the killing ground for mediocre movies or because they were hoping a movie with a Black lead would pull Black audiences biting Black History Month like Black Panther did. It definitely turns out that the first part of that suspicion is true, and I suspect the second part won‚Äôt be because it has the pandering stench.

The fact that the main plot in the movie is very clearly spoiled in the trailer kind of killed any tension in the movie. It kind of killed any of the tension, leaving us with, ‚ÄúWhen is he going to change?‚Äù for the entire film.

Bad script, and a movie that was built around a conspiracy that was neither interesting nor clever. Mackie deserved better. He brought everything he could to that rotten material. Even Ford, having deigned to join in on this crap, was doing good stuff. Carl Lumbly is a one-of-a-kind performer. Sabra was so distractingly bad it was nearly goofy.

I was tentatively looking forward to this after the Falcon+Winter Soldier show but I left the theater feeling... meh. Mackie doesn't have the same chemistry with Falcon Jr that he did with SebStan. Not bad, just not as good. The clunky/unsubtle dialogue doesn't help.

Pacing was jarring. Sometimes I feel like things just... happen? Like oh we're jumping to this scene now? And this character is here? Ok I guess I'll roll with it. I think the editing was part of why the stakes felt artificially inflated. I think the weird editing was why the stakes never really had a chance to sink in. 

CGI was definitely noticable and unpolished at times.  

Harrison Ford puts in a surprisingly good performance tho. Way deeper of a character than I was expecting.",def_not_cthulhu,3

I better not hear a peep ever again about The Marvels because that was a far and away better movie than this. Warts and all. How did we achieve the lack of fucks of a Sony Marvel movie in the mainline MCU? Did anything of this really matter? Does anyone actually care about Rulk post this movie?

* You could really tell that the scenes with Giancarlo were reshoots. They had a lot more life to them

* The direction and shot composition felt lacking too

* The sound design also felt really poor. Cap's shield didn't sound like it had any weight to it. Maybe that was just my theater though

The plot is just so thin. It's meant to be a ""grounded"" movie, sure, but John Wick presents a deep and colorful world while being grounded. This one doesn't: besides one concrete warehouse in Tokyo and Celestial Island the movie takes place in the same 70 mile radius. 

Being a movie centered on conspiracy theories, why is mind control seen as outlandish when the mystic arts exist and a middle aged white woman took control over a town in New Jersey? It even feels wrong that an entire branch of the government dedicated to handling alien tech, or even superpowered beings doesn't exist here. 

The source material is basically begging to be more interesting but they made the world smaller for some reason. The speeches, like Bucky's one, were just vague platitudes as well.

The assassination attempt was interesting and the mind control plot device had the makings of an intriguing paranoid thriller but the film doesn‚Äôt land its punches.

On paper the irony behind Sterns‚Äô plot is fun but so much of this film feels like a retread of previous Captain America movies but worse. You have the personal vendetta villain plot from Civil War but we don‚Äôt care about General Ross in the same way we cared about Iron Man / Cap / Bucky (doubly so because of William Hurts unfortunate death leading to the role being recast so it feels like even less of a continuation) & the ‚Äúanyone can be the enemy‚Äù plot line from Winter Solider but again less so because they‚Äôre mindless drones and not sleeper agents.

* I like Sam but he just doesn't make a good Captain America. I don't know if it's the lack of powers but he's just got support character energy. He has no presence, and going up against super villains, is kinda laughable. The real heroes are his sidekick robots. Those things seem to basically be able to do anything.
* Miscasting. Harrison Ford as the president? He's so old now I was worried he was gonna fall apart on screen. The Israeli midget as head of security? Wtf? Just awful and distracting.
* The villain again got no development, and had no depth.
* The choreography of the fighting was just okay, but everyone in this movie felt too old for their role. Anthony Mackie is starting to get up there in age and is starting to slow down in terms of physicality. Giancarlo Esposito is in his mid 60s. Harrison Ford is in his 80s.
* The story was just downright boring.
* I'm actually most disappointed we didn't get to make landing on Celestial Island. I wanted to see what the insides of that thing look like.

I‚Äôm not watching any game or movie trailer for last 6-7 years but they do show up on everywhere. Why in the hell they show Red Hulk in the trailers and everywhere ? 

That‚Äôs literally happening at the last arc. And you wouldn‚Äôt expect a red hulk if you are not a comic reader. I wasn‚Äôt and I would appreciate the movie more if I hadn‚Äôt know the fact Ross was the Red Hulk before watching the movie.

Don‚Äôt come up to me with ‚Äúeverybody knows Ross is Red Hulk‚Äù no we don‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt have to and it would have been nicer to not know. If you are comic fan and know he is what it is, than you don‚Äôt even need to see him in the trailer at the first place.

Sam Wilson, the main role guy, who you connect to most, try to emphasize, try to understand, he doesn‚Äôt know what Ross is going to become, that‚Äôs my point.

Other than that it‚Äôs a mid movie I suppose, that rotten tomato point and overhated comments without reasons suprises me. 

Lastly, one of the thing that I most realized (after 20 or MCU content) is MCU being MCU in such important scenes. For example: the part where US Navy and Japan Navy come across and that US jet fighter starts attacking Japan Navy. Bro that‚Äôs literally WW3 level tension. But they gave it 0 feeling to that. 0 tension, you don‚Äôt even feel what‚Äôs at stake, you don‚Äôt even understand the risks of it. All we seeing is 5 minutes of action and 20 seconds of Ross calling the Japanese Minister and talking to him like he is McDonalds employee and telling him: dude I didn‚Äôt want cheese in my Steak burger.  Bro where is the goddamn tension ???",ReisGoktug,2

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Every scene felt like it was 2-3 scenes combined into one to get all the info in as much as possible. Every character just throws out exposition, explains their motivations, or even describes what's going on in the very scene they are in. This had the worst TV writing I've seen in a long minute. On top of that, casting was VERY strange. I did not believe that girl as the president's bodyguard (?) for a single second. It almost felt like a student film in regards to how oddly put together this whole thing was. And why this became a sequel to The Incredible Hulk is beyond me. Giancarlo Esposito's character serves no purpose, what an absolute waste of him in the MCU. You can tell this was just tinkered to death. Even the action was mid. Let's also not forget, they neuter the hell out of the charasmatic Anthony Mackie and also give his character nothing to lose or care about -- not a love interest, no recurring family, nothing. It's been over a dozen appearances from him in the MCU now and we know next to nothing about his past or social life?

I really wish they just turned Falcon and the Winter Solider into a movie. That had a way better plot, more interesting characters, and would've lead directly into Thunderbolts freshly with the John Walker stuff. Instead, this just passes on the mantle and does absolutely nothing with it. He feels nothing like Captain America, the vibe of the movie was nothing like Captain America, the implications of being Captain America didn't seem to have the weight necessary in this story for it to be his first solo outing. The MCU is so far down in the hole right now, it is unbelievable. This needs to be a wake up call to Feige to literally STOP everything before this gets any worse. No more TV shows, just focus on the movies and better quality control. This is getting out of hand.

Best positives I can say about this movie is I liked that it felt like a 90s action thriller. I wasn't entirely bored to death. It's better than Quantumania, Black Widow, and The Marvels, but not by a lot. I also like the new Falcon, just wish he had better dialogue to spout off.

The original was a great origin story, Winter Soldier was a really fun action thriller and Civil War was a great emotional ride showing the rift that divided the Avengers. But one thing they all had were stakes; it felt like the things that happened in the plot had weight. 

This one just ruined the whole ass twist in the marketing so there were just no stakes in anything. A story about the new Captain America having to come out of Steve Rogers' shadow and prove he has what it takes to carry the name *should* have been a script that wrote itself. It's a great premise that was let down by the writing.

i also cant stand how inconsistent Sam's suit is: if its such a gripe that he isnt a supersoldier then his suit shouldnt be doing supersoldier stuff idc the deus ex machine tech they want to put in it. even if the suit can absorb some energy he is fully going flying his bones should be shattering. like he 'caught' a flagpole from red hulk cmon 

also i found it very distracting that we're supposed to believe that the 5 foot nothing agent was beating up some seals. i know shes ex widow but it was really distracting seeing her stand what looked like feet below everyone else to the point that casting a taller actress would have made it a nonissue.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],18/02/2025,"(My review is very choppy because I‚Äôm just typing out what remember)


The movie wasn‚Äôt bad. The editing was bad like kraven. Where at some points mackie looked cgi while red hulk looked real at the cherry blossom by the water sceneüíÄ. Speaking of cherry blossoms, that fight scene looks like they were fighting in japan. The suits I didn‚Äôt really like especially the new falcon but I did like his wings. 

The music wasn‚Äôt matching with the vibes especially the ending credits, they should have picked something else like make a rendition of Captain America‚Äôs theme. 

The best scenes though out (excluding Sebastian‚Äôs of course, 2nd best and Harrison and stern phone scene on the ship, 3rd best) was the Camp Echo One. It gives the vibe of Captain America winter soldier when capt and widow went into the bunker, seeing the Zola computer. Those scenes were scary asf to me mostly because of ww1 and ww2 was a sad and terrifying war to learn about. And the colors, the set was just adding to me being scared. It made me want a game just about camp echo one like amnesia: the bunker (of course I‚Äôm not playing just want to watch someone else play itüíÄ). 

Tim b Nelson killed it of course, especially his opening and his phone manipulation to President Ross, was really good. I felt terrible for thinking he needs to cover his face up especially his introduction to Sam when he turned the light on, I quickly said turn that shit back off.ü§£üíÄüíÄ 

Harrison ford‚Äôs acting was really good better that his Indiana Jones he did recently. I never watched Ford‚Äôs movie to its full extent till the 2023 Indiana jones. 

Esposito‚Äôs acting was of course good, no one should expect him to do bad.

Almost Everyone‚Äôs acting was really good except Liv, shira, and a little bit of Mackie. Mackie just seems so excited about the project (which is never a bad thing) that it showed through out even in serious moments. Liv Tyler‚Äôs acting fing suck for just tiny scenes, the phone part was bothering the hell out of me with the long pauses and her robotic voice. It made me think Dr.Sterns had took her hostage, and ai her voice to call President Ross.  

The movie is a 6/10 for me.",Middle_Breakfast_868,2

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Yes it‚Äôs a basic plot. **That is exactly what the fuck people have been asking for.** 

Literally since Endgame people have wanted something that‚Äôs back to basics. No convoluted multiverse shit, no hare-brained schemes. I mean fuck they put a character in this movie that hadn‚Äôt been seen in almost 20 years and his appearance makes perfect sense. 

Anthony Mackie is great. I think he embodies the grit and undying will of Cap more so than the ‚Äúsymbol of hope‚Äù that he was as Steve Rogers. They have to be different Captain Americas and people have to realize that in order to like this. He has to he allowed to lead and carry the shield differently than Steve. The action was awesome. Watching him continue to improve his aerial combat is a nice touch. Somebody said Cap shouldn‚Äôt kick the shield, **fucking why?????** he‚Äôs Captain America. He should be able to juggle that thing with his tongue for all we care. His fights with Red Hulk were great and he was in the movie FAR more than a lot of reviews led to believe. 

Villains were good. Sidewinder was a perfect little side villain. Just enough of a badass to not take too much attention. Leader looks fuckin gnarly. Not identical to the comic appearance but in my opinion it is in no way a distasteful representation of the source material. I will say I think his powers rely heavily on suspending your sense of disbelief. In the way you have to see Hulk as literally un-killable, you have to see Leader as an unfathomably intelligent mind. It seems like poor writing but I think it‚Äôs really just how OP Leader is. 

Overall I‚Äôd genuinely give this one like a 7.8/10. It‚Äôs SUCH an improvement on the recent MCU formula. I couldn‚Äôt care less if the plot is a little basic, I think that‚Äôs exactly what they need right now.",brbmycatexploded,2

It had good suspense and buildup similar to the old cap movies and had a solid action payoff to the build. Was it safe? Sure. But that doesn't mean it's bad by virtue of being safe.

It also had about half a year of reshoots and boy does it show. 

Mackie was great, I‚Äôm kinda sold on him as Cap now. Ford obviously was too. Isaiah Bradley had me glued to the screen, as did Esposito, but those two are given the least screentime of anyone in the entire movie. The action was solid but went from a 8 or 9 at the start to about a 4 or 5 by the end. Got used to the Leader‚Äôs look by the end of the movie but by god he reminded me so much of the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Come Into The Basement‚Äù guy from Goosebumps. Red Hulk should NOT have been spoiled by marketing, because that ending was underwhelming as hell.

I think the core concept of the movie works. Political thriller, preexisting villains messing with plans to put together more heroes and cause anarchy. But it would‚Äôve been much better if A.) it were 30 minutes longer and B.) were a mini Avengers film. If you add War Machine and Smart Hulk into this movie, two characters BEGGING for more screentime and in a natural position to contribute, it‚Äôs so much more of a draw.

It‚Äôs fine, marginally above average for a superhero action film. There are a few nice places where they actually let the actors work for a living.

I got the impression that many people in the audience were confused and didn‚Äôt know who Sterns or Ross were or why they‚Äôd be connected to the Hulk.

I was pleased that they didn‚Äôt cheat and re-use Batman‚Äôs secret weapon against Superman from Justice League and that it was just Sam vs Rulk in the end. No unpowered people waiting to push a button.

I did like the aerial stuff over Tiamut though, and briefly thought maybe they‚Äôd played a blinder and the cherry blossoms was a fake like the Homecoming and Infinity War trailers - Red Hulk tearing through a ship and then fighting on the celestial corpse would‚Äôve been cool

Also - a fan of the final fight being short and ending with Sam talking him down. There‚Äôs only so many times he can be hit by Ross before you‚Äôd get bored and it‚Äôs very in character

There was like hints of some politics with them going straight for death penalty with Isaiah (but no mention of it for the white dudes) and I was relieved we never got the Israeli one‚Äôs real name mentioned although really, that character was extraneous. Nothing changes if she‚Äôs not in it!

Worst credits scene of the entire MCU imo. So vague, sounds more like a sinister version of Fury at the end of Iron Man being like ‚Äúthere are more heroes!‚Äù. Should‚Äôve at least actually named the multiverse - Sam hasn‚Äôt encountered it, could set up potentially who he seeks out for his new Avengers team

I liked that they talked about the greater MCU without it feeling forced. The Celestial, the Red Room, Bucky, Serpent Society, Banner, etc. were all just natural parts of the story. It wasn't like ""here's this vital piece of info for another movie."" I guess Sam setting up the Avengers but that was obviously going to happen from someone. 

I like that none of the villains died. Marvel Studios loves wasting villains so it's nice that all three are in prison. So we're definitely going to see them again. 

My only serious gripe is Sam basically doing super soldier shit without the serum. Not just surviving, I mean all of the martial arts stuff. It feels a bit ridiculous watching him do a bunch of spin bicycle kicks and throwing the Shield around like he has Hawkeye's accuracy. New Falcon fighting the same way is also kind of ridiculous.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],15/02/2025,"This was essentially a bridge film to tie up old Hulk subplots and setup Phase 6. This needed more standalone film value. And the real shame of it all is that the answer was staring these writers in the face. All you needed to change was adding a **2nd act scene where Thunderbolt Hulks out**. Don't hold the transformation till the end. That would fix issues with Sam Wilson's rudderless direction assuming the Cap mantle throughout the movie and also raise the stakes in the big, finale fight.

*Putting on my re-writing cap:*

Thunderbolt at the helm of the warship heading to Celestial Island to intercept Japan.  Thunderbolt is wrestling with his rage as all of the recent events are starting to come to a head. Falcon has been assigned to accompany the President on the warship heading to Celestial Island, splitting up from Captain America, who's still on the case to clear Isaiah's name. Thunderbolt loses control on the ship and Hulks out. Falcon and Red Hulk fight, Falcon gets smashed, and ends up severely injured. Cut to: Cap at the hospital to hear the grim news about Falcon, approaches Falcon's bedside and gives that great speech about the pressures to be perfect as Captain America because people will get hurt if he isn't perfect.

Further plot perfection achieved if the writers find a way to have Thunderbolt turn into Red Hulk and not have his staff (or the world) know Red Hulk and Ross are the same person. Then you could sprinkle in extra scenes of Harrison Ford as President Ross is wrestling to control his anger to prevent turning back into Red Hulk leading up to the finale.

The Sam Wilson speech at the end of movie to Falcon was EXACTLY what I needed to hear to believe in Sam as Captain America and to outline his motivation. Terrible decision putting that great speech at the end. If Marvel was going to use the 'suns getting real low' strategy to defeat the Red Hulk at the end (and really...how else is Sam Wilson beating the Hulk??), they needed that 2nd act Falcon vs Red Hulk fight to show his destruction powers against regular humans and ramp up the tension in the finale.

Actually, I think there's some suggestions a version of this was included in the film. There's a clip in the trailers showing Israeli Widow and Cap's BFF Head of Security down in the ship with their guns drawn. Wonder who was the threat they were hunting down?",jseto1980,1

Anyone feel like this movie was made by committee? Just lacking in character and thesis. A great strength of Captain America is the man-out-time nature. The idealism and moral clarity is a great juxtaposition to realpolitik. It appeals to the better nature of the audience when the protagonist like Captain America won't stop being Captain America. I don't think that this movie did a good job of recasting Captain America. And defining Sam Wilson as someone to fill those boots. He's quite literally dropped into the opening act of the movie and doesn't get the characterization necessary for his character to stand on his own. In Cap 1, Steve Rogers gets the entire first act to define his character before he even gets the serum. We don't get that for Sam Wilson. 

And because we don't get that, it feels like his character is simply reacting to events rather than influencing them.

Like there's the bones of a tight 90s'-00's political thriller in there somewhere. And then it has the hulk plot, it has the adamantium plot device, it has the black widow knock off. In the end, you need to have a familiarity with like 6+ marvel properties to be able to pickup what's going on. It's just so burdened by the extra elements that the actual story feels periphery. 

Which is why there was such a dependence on expository dialogue. To the point where the, frequent, news voiceover almost acted as a narrator. Actually, I think that's what they did. You don't see any actual news casts, it's just constantly in the background. I can just see a producer sitting there after a test screening saying that the audience would have no idea what's going on.

If you evaluate the movie by itself, it fails in pacing, dialogue, characterization, scoring, editing, and acting. 

If you evaluate the movie within the broader MCU, more like an episode of a tv show, it probably moves up to a C-. It still has the above failures, but it's still a step back in quality from other Captain America movies.",mooseman780,1
Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"Just left my screening. The movie was ‚Äúokay‚Äù not good or great but not completely terrible I would rate it 5/10. I have a few minor gripes and one big gripe personally. 

First, I will start with my biggest gripe.
I personally felt the movie did not shine enough light and/or elaborate on Tiamut (celestial island). I have been waiting since 2021 for further explanation on his emergence and how it affected the world. The only reason I decided to give this movie a shot was to the the repercussions of Tiamut his emergence would have called massive earth quakes as well as mass amounts of water displacement. I had hoped we would get an inside look in him as well as how the mining operation could affect the future due to Tiamut being essentially earth core. Instead what we got was japan and the U.S. fighting over ‚Äúcelestial island‚Äù for Adamtanium rights which was an okay plot but. Feel a huge waste of story potential. 

Now for my minor gripes:
- underutilized use of Betty Ross (I have been waiting for something from her since the Incredible Hulk and was excited when she was mentioned) I was disappointed she only showed up in the end credits with two unimportant lines.

-green screen/cgi/reshoots I felt were poorly done at some points in the film. 

-Story telling , I felt the way the dialogue came across was that marvel was explaining everything to us as if we were in the first grade spoon feeding us the plot as if we couldn‚Äôt pick up on it from the trailers. 

-underutilized Giancarlo Eposito , he had very little screen time but was memorable in the moments he was in. 

-Samuel Sterns, I did enjoy seeing again as I did not expect an appearance from him at all so tat was a pleasant surprise although I feel as a villain he fell flat his plot was essentially not entirely useless but not really necessary as the whole ‚Äúoh shucks you ruined my plan so I will have to turn myself in for my other plan captain America‚Äù like the whole thing just fell flat.

When Sterns locked sam and torres in his lab, it could be the perfect moment to sneak in some super soldier serum to Sam. Just sayin', clearly bro needs one.

And c'mon, using Ross' daughter to calm his ass would be a better solution than sam's stupid ass speech. It would mirror what happened to Bruce in the hulk movie perfectly.

Man, this movie feels like a reset. They tried to cut some loose ends, make a safe ass bland movie and start to do a fresh rebuild. Hopefully, they don't fk up the next movie after this reset but my expectations are very low at this point.

Macky brings a ton of heart Sam as cap. He really sold me this time. With the exception of one absolutely insane bullshit feat of strength they actually show his weakness in the movie and how hard he has to work to keep up with the other supers.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"So Captain America was great. Solid 8/10. 

The Good: 

-Anthony Mackie, Tim Blake Nelson and especially Harrison Ford put on some great performances. Ford also seemed to be enjoying his role because you can tell when he takes a paycheck and when he likes a role.

-The aerial fight scenes were really good. Very intense and some great use of Captain America's new suit.

-Movie moved fast for being 2 hours and managed to keep the pace going.

The Bad:

-While the writing is pretty great throughout, it does do one thing that a lot of movies nowadays too too much, they don't let emotional moments be emotional. They always have to throw a line that breaks the uplifting moment or a tension filled moment.

-I'm glad the writers continued the comic writer's trend of making Sabra an unlikeable character. That being said, she didn't need to be in the movie. 

-The movie needed more Isiah Bradley, I want to hear more of his story.

Brighter costumes, dopier scripts with bigger concepts than the story can actually sustain, a more ad-hoc approach to continuity -- this is what made Marvel great.",Indrid_Cold23,-1
Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"This was an average film with some good moments.


This film was an average film that had some good moments.

The characters were fine in this film and the plot was generic and very predictable.

This film was a more story driven MCU Film which is a good thing usually but the story was very predictable and the trailers gave away way too much of it.

The first act of this film was the best part of this film and the second act was pretty generic. The third act was decent but most of it was in the trailers so that made the third act feel a little more boring.

Sam Wilson does prove to be a good Captain America and Thunderbolt Ross was another good character that was played very well by Harrison Ford.


Overall this was an average film that had okay characters. The plot was very generic and predictable and that made the film boring at a lot of times.",darthyogi,-1
Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],15/02/2025,"I like this movie

The marketing team made this seem like it's Cap v Red Hulk. It's not. The massive fight scene from the trailers is on the comedown of the movie. But I'm fine with that.

The 'The Incredible Hulk sequel without Hulk' argument is bullshit. This movie sets up a hulk story, especially with Betty coming back. It should've been a surprise that Ross is red hulk, rather than the main ad point, but again, thats on Marketing. It's important to remember they just got the rights back to hulk in 2023. Give it time. 

Danny Ramirez is good. Joaquin bounces off Sam well, and kinda softens him a little which made me like Anthony Mackie more. He's significantly less corny in this. 

Carl MF Lumbly is incredible man. He just is. It's almost cheating using him as the emotional bait. Steve gets moody about Bucky and Fury, the coldest bastards in the world. I was mad as fuck when they put cuffs on my guy Isaiah Bradley.

The suit was fine. we know nanotech is a cop out, but suit CGI didn't look bad like everyone's saying. It was really too quick to tell. Everything looks bad when you screenshot the trailer on an android. RH CG was good. Clearly a lot more time spent on him than on Leader. They need to make a  better decision on if he's CG or practical. He was like a weird, grotesque mixture. Will probably be cleaned up for digital. 

The story was good. Sure, it's not a groundbreaking take on a Cap story. But I think if they went too far in any direction everyone would've been pissed off that they're changing what makes a Captain America movie. The structure and plot are similar to WS. I think that works. We see Sam go through the things that Steve went through. 

Theres a plot hole in the second act when Ross still doesn't want Cap to help even though he knows the leader is up to some shit. That doesn't make sense, and was clearly there so Sam could pull him aside and say ""I know what it's like to have something to prove"". But thats the only 'culture service' that I caught. I could've used more of Joaquin convincing Sam and Sam reluctantly letting him help. Possibly more of Sam grueling over him getting hurt, and that coming out in the RH fight. That felt like a promising emotional storyline that just kind of fell off. It also could've collided with Ross/Betty arc if they had used that correctly. They must not have been able to get her there the day of the big fight. Because after 2 minutes of fighting - Sam just talks him down? And then she just shows up later in jail when theres no stakes at all...? She could've stood in front of him the way she stood in front of bruce in TIH. For sure seems like that was written and there were production issues. All that being said, I still teared up when she walked in at the end.

I remembering seeing TIH with my dad in theaters. We stand up to leave and he says ""hang on. remember iron man had a post credits scene?"". I remember feeling like we were going to get in trouble for staying in the theater after the movie, then - Ross,  drunk at a bar. Tony walks in - ""I'm starting a team"" And all this begins.   

Regardless of whether any of us agree, I'm glad we're all still talking about it.",Smart-Ship7330,-1

People. GO FORM YOUR OWN OPINION ON THE MOVIE. I love Marvel. I have grown up with these movies since I was in first grade and I‚Äôll be honest, I have lost faith in them over time, especially after endgame, especially these past four years. I‚Äôve liked/loved some of their projects the last few years, and I‚Äôve also disliked some as well. I‚Äôve had plenty of issues with MOM, L&T, Quantumania, the Marvels, I could keep going. 

This movie was honestly amazing. I think GOTG vol 3 for the record has been marvels best film since endgame, I would put this right below it. The action, the performances were great. SAMUEL STERNS AS THE VILLAIN?!? Dude was so creepy and awesome. It‚Äôs a true back to form marvel movie. So much good pay off and references from past projects while also setting up what‚Äôs to come. It was great. I was so skeptical going into it and I can honestly say the negative reviews are a bunch of bs. There‚Äôs maybe one scene you can tell that was reshot but that doesn‚Äôt bring the movie down at all imo. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about the movie, it didn‚Äôt feel rushed it accomplished what it needed to do. I could see myself seeing this again in the theatre.

that is one of the core issues with marvel and DC: the constant escalation of threats. You introduce a multiverse, ok, cool. years later, you need to do something more, you introduce gods. And then Mega-gods that created the gods, and maybe a second layer of multiverses that is multiversally different from the first multiverse. 

it's just a constant escalation of threats, with a dozen layers of Gods each one more godly and threatening than the one before. when you reach a breaking point, reboot everything, start from zero, do it again.

Which scenes specifically are you talking about? Because I had heard people say this in early reviews so I was watching for it, but I didn't notice much. There were some weak fight scenes in the prison area where the choreography wasn't good, but for the most part the fights seemed good. It was more the directors' camera work when capturing the fights that I found lacking. 

As for bad CG my biggest issue was the scenes in daylight outside Washington. There's some parts where it's noticeable that they shot that scene on a green screen set. But even then there wasn't anything I'd call borderline PS3 quality.",LewisLightning,3

storywise makes no sense. Sam has literally been with Steve since he met him, and agreed with his every move. Whether that was becoming a fugitive from the law (twice), joining his Avengers, or even joining Steve‚Äôs secret Avengers. Sam literally acted like Captain America and was with Steve every step of the way. Why wouldn‚Äôt he be Captain America? 

Bucky literally didn‚Äôt want to fight. In infinity war, he was tired of fighting. In TFATWS, he was going around killing people involved with the Winter Soldier program. He wasn‚Äôt Captain America, and never acted like it. 

People only say Bucky should be Cap because he‚Äôs a much more likable character than Sam, who has been boring most of his MCU existence. But ignoring popularity, and just going off of the story, Sam should‚Äôve always been Cap, and Bucky should‚Äôve never even been considered.",-Nick____,2

Not just that, but also how the world was affected by the snap, how borders opened and the survivors rebuilt what they had. Then when everyone came back, they borders closed, refugees lost their benefits, the survivors were kicked out of their homes. Even tiny stuff like Sam ironing his clothes, or Bucky having PTSD and not being able to sleep on a bed. It was THE human mcu project, and the highlight of the show

The film should have been like this: Ross becomes President and puts on a friendly face to Sam, promising to put the past behind him and work together. But the Serpent Society and the Leader work to instigate crises and chaos which undermine's Ross' administration by compromising America's standing with the release of dark secrets about the President's past and causing him to revert to the hard-headed, irascible personality from his time as a General. Being manipulated by the gamma radiation in his heart medication pills planted by the Serpent Society, he grows more irate and morally compromising in his actions to restore American pride and authority on the world stage, which rankles with Cap. Just as planned, a schism erupts between Cap & Ross as time goes which the Society and the Leader exploit to stoke the flames of war and advance their agenda. Things come to a head when Ross eventually does something beyond the pale (a military invasion or some other high-stakes action) and Cap publicly goes against the President, so Cap gets betrayed by an enraged Ross & made out to be a dangerous, renegade like how Cap was in Winter Soldier - falsely implicated in shady events. Forced into hiding, Cap then turns to Isiah as someone who he can not only trust, but who was also betrayed by his Government and disposed of.

Deciphering the conspiracy with the help of Haas, the two Captain Americas suit up to kick ass along with Falcon and set out to take down Ross who by now has been driven to the edge of madness...when the Society make their final move by kidnapping his daughter Betty & taking her hostage - revealing it by hijacking a White House press conference and making it look like Cap's doing as revenge. Pushed over the edge of anger, he transforms into Red Hulk to the astonished horror of the watching world. Arriving on the scene, the Caps try to explain the situation but Ross is too irate with Hulk rage to listen and launches into a furious assault. The White House becomes Ground Zero to a titanic battle as Isiah's super-serum strength, Sam's Wakandan combat gear & Falcon's aerial combat prowess combine to take on the writhing rage of Hulk.

It's too much for our heroes however, and just when it looks like the Society is about to prevail by killing Cap and destroying Ross' Presidency, Betty arrives and pleads to him to see the good in people, as she does in him. Witnessing the vulnerability in his daughter and overcome with emotion that she came to help him even after years of estrangement and emnity, he reverts to human form and voluntarily hands himself in before he causes any more damage.",CaptainKursk,3

Which is almost an adequate explanation.

Almost.

The problem is that it's completely and utterly thematically undercut by the fact that Sam is flying around in a multimillion dollar suit with potentially a multibillion dollar suite of Wakandan tech and resources. Bucky says that Sam gives people someone to aspire to because he doesn't have superpowers. Yet, he has so much tech, absolutely unobtainable by 99% of the population, that he is still incredibly unrelatable to most normal people.  

I don't look at Sam and go, ""oh wow he's a hero without the serum, I can be just like him!"". I look at Sam and go, ""You're zooming at supersonic speeds with cutting edge tech and fighting huge threats, you may as well just take the serum already to increase your ability to be a hero.""

Cause while Sam's over here struggling with this big random goon at the start of the movie, the bad guys move the hostages to a different area with guns pointed at them, and they could've been killed at any time. If he had the serum he would have fodderized the goon in one punch and saved the hostages. Instantly.",XeroShyft,9

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],17/02/2025,"I'm with you.  Sam doesn't seem to work as the Cap character.  Some people trying to make this about race, but it is more about the character development.

Steve has Sam and Nat as his main teammates in the previous movies. Steve is earnest, but a tad bit naive, not his fault, born in a different time. Sam and Nat play off that well because they are Skeptics, Less Trusting.

Same thing in Avengers. Tony, Thor, Hulk all very different characters than Steve. This works great for the chemistry in those movies. It would be super boring to have 20 Captain Americas.

Probably the closest character in terms of earnest compassion was TChalla. But obviously as a Non-American he was never going to be in the running for Captain. And BP is already a top tier hero.

I don't think Bucky works great, other than maybe with a redemption arc and eventually sacrifice. And I don't think Sam works great because he built a character as ""witty, sarcastic, skeptical"" and I don't think they had success in transforming him into Cap.",footballaccount12121,1

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025," The unfortunate truth of the matter is that at this point the MCU has likely run its course, along with superhero movies in general. People have been debating ""superhero fatigue"" for years, but looking back at the history of film, no genre can be dominant forever. Combine that with the sheer scope of the MCU, and its collapsing under its own weight. That doesnt mean that no superhero or MCU movie can be a hit, but it does mean that only ones that really stand our or feature fan favorite characters will hit. Marvel will have to likely both reduce its output, and redouble its efforts to make every movie and show special.i think they've already been working to right the ship, but the signs of trouble came while Brave New World was already in production, and big rewrites and reshoots couldn't save it.

It has great conclusion for a lot of character arcs, is rife with possibilities for the new team, fantastic environmental story telling, stylistic and memorable music, I could go on, it's got the whole 9 yards. The Guardians films knocked it out of the park, 3/3 for me, which none of the other series properties consistently achieved. Captain Marvel movies were just okay, and Black Panther I would say 1.5/2 were good. Namor was the only part I cared for in it. 

Back on topic, the other shows, too, aren't being addressed. There were giant gods fighting in Egypt 3 years ago, She-Hulk hasn't been connected also 3 years ago(possibly in DareDevil? I haven't seen anything besides the trailer), and Shang Chi has also been left hanging 4 years ago. The only ""conclusion"" was WandaVision's with Multiverse of Madness, but that movie has its own loose end with the post credit scene, 3 years on.

I‚Äôve made so many excuses for the MCU over the last few years. Up until now, I felt there was something I could enjoy even in the movies I thought were not great; good character moments, fun action scenes, interesting (if undeveloped) themes. But this movie was just so cynical in how it tried to lazily recycle plot and thematic elements from Winter Soldier and Civil War because they know people liked those movies, but with no idea *why* or how to recreate that feeling.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],20/02/2025,"And existential crisis is an over reaction but I think this film will be the ‚Äòwaking point‚Äô for many where they begin to or fully give up on the MCU. This film offered us nothing and everyone in the film bar Wilson and Bucky probably won‚Äôt be seen again, especially Red Hulk and Stern.  

This film didn‚Äôt move the MCU narrative forwards in any way and it didn‚Äôt even try something new, it‚Äôs a worse Winter Soldier in just about every way. The other bad movies served to progress the MCU‚Äôs overarching plot line at a minimum but this did nothing.  

The fact we have the asterisks later this year and a Fantastic Four we still don‚Äôt even know the plot of (kind of like this movie) shows they‚Äôve lost their touch. ‚ÄúNot Tony Stark‚Äù reappearing is another sign the franchise is toast. I think you‚Äôll see more and more people now wait for reviews before considering an MCU movie over it being a release date must-watch.  

I was hoping the movie would offer something to take away but it didn‚Äôt, my expectations for all 3 films this year were already rather low and I won‚Äôt bother watching the others until they are out and reviews known.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],16/02/2025,"My opinion as well. Humility and morals aside, Sam needs the serum. He almost got his shit pushed in by a big goon in a church, all while Sidewinder ran off and was free to do more evil shit off screen. Sam with the serum would have no-diffed the goon and caught Sidewinder, and the plot of this movie would have been cut in half. From a logical perspective, the writing in inadvertently made a powerless Captain America indirectly endanger everyone involved in this plot. having the serum means you're stronger, faster, and can do you your hero job with a higher rate of success + save more people. Sam Wilson isn't relatable as he stands now. He has access to amazing hackers, Wakandan technology, and is probably making a great salary as a former avenger and Captain America. I don't like this writing in trying to portray him as relatable and something to aspire to. If I was in the MCU as a random civilian, someone flying around with elite military training and vibranium wings would NOT be something I could aspire to, or relate to.

Dr Strange and The !ultiverse isn't a sequel to Dr Strange. It's a sequel to wandavision and Spiderman no way home, and references to what if and more.

I'm at best only familiar with the characters existence, and they just feel like those Sonic fan characters teens in 2005 all had. Hey, it's hulk... but he's red now! That along with 'lore accurate character power scaling' feels like something that is only interesting to a very slim amount of hardcore fans and an active turnoff to everyone else, see also: Multiverses.

If you want to run a franchises' interest into the ground making characters just 'reskins' of existing ones, or in fact literally the same character but 'from an alternate timeline', while making the actual plotting bland and the movie gray and very obviously overly full of CGI just seems like a sure bet.

I don't think it's much surprise that my favourite superhero movies of the past few years have mostly involved relatively unknown characters (Suicide Squad, The) or ones that haven't been wildly over-represented on screen (Riddler). While The Flash makes its core climax about The Flash saving a version of Superman from a Kevin Smith anecdote about the producer of The Wild Wild West and that's really not me spinning the truth particularly hard.

It also required marvel to be in a state of fixing movies in post production which is what led to films like multiverse of madness, love and thunder, the marvels, quantumania, the marvels, and brave new world having so many reshoots and plot reworks though the earlier ones were required to change to chapeks orders. For brave new world and born again, while it didn‚Äôt end up saving brave new world as much as I hoped, they were into production when Bob iger came back in in which they let Kevin Feige have full control of marvel again in which he ordered both projects to be reworked because they were leading towards being bad projects.

No, why? Couldn't he just send the videos of himself talking about all Ross crimes to all the reporters and the public?

Why showing up to be caught right there? There is no way it's more effective because what if the guards just taped his mouth up and brought him right back to the cell? The nobody would know he was there. It feels even stranger that the reporters, while sitting there listening to the President, knew about his presence and his detailed story while he's being facedown on the grass somewhere else. Did some reporters ran there and listened to the strange green man on the grass explaining his life story while the cops were waiting patiently for him to finish his plan?

To make it worse, making the public witness Ross' transformation or know about his crimes was not his top priority, because on the battleship, he tried to turn Ross into Hulk without anyone around!

How could foresee that, considering this is a man who calculated a distant fight with 77% of some random action. The whole thing between this genius and Ross is really sloppy the more we think about it. 

Like, Ross kept this man there because he needed the meds, and the man who provided him the crucial meds, got mad because Ross did not keep his promise, so he planned to ruin his life by....turning him into Hulk? 

I mean, he saved Ross life with his medical treatment, why not using some medical threat to assure his freedom? And does keeping one prisoned so he can keep you alive...sound really  unstable? 

2nd, with the mind controlling method, he could get out of the cell easily, why waiting until Ross became the president to see if Ross would free him as promised? You can do it yourself man!

Lastly, if freedom is so nice, why showing up to get caught? I understand he hates Ross for breaking his promise and keeping him prisoned, but why giving up on your very dream, just to prove to the man that you can take revenge? Isn't it better to live free and take revenge from your secret place? Showing up to get caught is the most silly thing I ever saw, why do that?

Since they wanted to double down on Cap not being a super soldier, then keep his inspiring part and bring in the anime power of friendship I don't know.

It WAS in fact very easy to detect the gamma radiation, since Sam's buddy in the Army/Marines literally said on-screen that he just needed 24 hours to check the pills, during which time he found out they were full of gamma.

Granted, they also said that Stern had gradually been upping the dosage over time, so maybe Ross only had the pills tested at the start and then once he got used to taking them he just never bothered re-checking for alterations to the dosage?

The original Avengers teaser is for Thanos - no Avenger is present for this and it in no way benefits in-world plot.

Wilson told the president about the drugs so it's not like the president was not aware of that. What would he do when he got the result? Meet the president again and tell him the drugs we both know were sneaky but you needed to be alive, are indeed bad?

By the way, did Wilson just have one single guy to transfer the information and once he's dead, everything's lost? How about the guy he was talking on the phone? His comrades who found him dead? Someone else should have taken the information and knew the seriousness of it?

And why Wilson looked so chilled seeing the Leader right there when the president's talking. He even smiled like he won because the Leader somehow just showed to up be caught?

Captain America: Brave New World,Official Discussion - Captain America: Brave New World [SPOILERS],14/02/2025,"I haven't seen this movie so I can't say how bad the writing/directing are, but I am talking about the scale of the conflict. A relatively small, personal conflict like in Iron Man or Thor is compelling because the heroes are relatable. At its heart, Iron Man is about a moral conflict between a man who has seen the error of his ways and tried to change and a man who has not. Thor is about a powerful person being brought low and gradually becoming (slightly) more humble. The stories are focused on character development, and the action largely exists to serve that purpose.


In later movies, especially ones that feature more characters from other movies, character development is pushed to the side to make room for more action that advances the overarching plot of the MCU. And once our heroes defeat a villain who threatens to destroy/take over the world, a smaller, less powerful villain won't be challenging, so they must face even larger, more powerful villains who threaten to destroy the universe, and then time itself. The story is now less about personal growth and more about two action figures punching each other. And two action figures punching each other is perfectly fine, but it's not really compelling.


When every movie is like that, and when every plot seems to only be focused on setting up another movie that isn't the one you're watching, it gets pretty old. You keep watching movies that set up other movies with the expectation that eventually you'll get to the movie with the payoff, but no one wants to keep doing that forever.",Not_Phil_Spencer,6

I will say though, to their credit here, compared to post credits scenes that never get paid off (and some that don't actually seem to expect to get paid off), this one is better than that.

It sets an unrealistic as hell standard to expect that, Especially from a character like Sam who isn‚Äôt supposed to be superhuman (feats aside, I mean this is marvel.. if Iron Man can fight Thanos unaugmented then Sam can surf on a missile, sue me)

In fact a major part of Sam‚Äôs story is How he‚Äôs *not* superhuman. He‚Äôs *not* Steve Rogers.

Hit-Girl getting her ass kicked by Frank and Mother Russia I see as a deconstructionist take on the kid sidekick trope you see in comic books and superhero media. She's still very tough and skilled, but that came at the expense of her demented father robbing her of a normal childhood, and while she is a terrific crime fighter, when up against grown adults without weapons, she's going to struggle. Kick-Ass is a satirical take on superheroes.

His ability to convey so much emotion-whether it‚Äôs pain, guilt, or the struggle to regain his identity-through minimal dialogue is what makes his performance stand out.

I don't think he is that insecure and by all accounts he is just a genuine guy who doesn't take himself too seriously... so I doubt it will come up.  That is the difference between someone who emphasizes the character they're playing vs. someone who emphasizes themselves.

I still don't really like Mackie's character as Captain America as he is mostly a regular guy with a suit (while lacking the genius of Stark)... but as a human being and actor, Mackie seems to be a class act.  So I'm pulling for him.",Xynomite,2

Is that why it‚Äôs called Brave New World? Cuz if that isn‚Äôt all accidental and deliberate. I‚Äôm so fucking in. Love Anthony. Cool dude. He‚Äôs everything A-Train wish he could be, but *actual* haha. No super powers. No serum. Just, grit and heart and spirit. Not throwing away his wings for the shield. He‚Äôs a fusion.

I‚Äôm sure this connects with a lot of young black people in America. I think it‚Äôs awesome he gets to be the new Captain and not Bucky. I get it. ‚ÄúRace this, race that‚Äù but bro. Race is a real fucking thing, real generational trauma, still being abused today by the wrong people with power, who comes from a generational chain of people who held the whips. I‚Äôm just saying.

The multiverse stuff has stuck around way too long and I can‚Äôt wait for it to not be a factor anymore.

I do hope as they wrap it up by Loki bringing together a multiversal avengers team to beat the final bad guy.

First, the MCU feels like it‚Äôs sort of a victim of its own success. It‚Äôs hard to follow something as great and iconic as the infinity war saga.

Red Hulk is also an 82 year old whose powers are derivative of the actual Hulk. So it's not the same there either.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"The whole gimmick with vibranium is that it can absorb huge amounts of kinetic energy without any of it impacting the person holding/wearing it. That's been the gimmick for *decades* and is what allows Captain America (who in the comics is not as ""super"" as in the movies) to take blows from foes like the Hulk and not be turned to paste. A normal human can hold it and stand against a tank shell. In the Winter Soldier movie, it's why he could plunge 20 stories, land on the shield, and be fine.

No, it doesn't obey real world physics. Comic book/superhero stuff never does.

But yes, *in world*, the whole schtick with vibranium is that it would allow a normal person to block huge amounts of force without that force crunching them to pieces. That's the whole gimmick.",blackphiIibuster,10

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"I ask theae questions because we had a whole show where they kept droning on and on about how a regular human would get decimated by a super strong being and to have a chance at all he'd have to take super serum.

When falcon and the winter soldier came out it was the same time as invincible so we'd get an episode where they'd drone on about him not standing a chance if he didn't take super serum and then he'd dodge a hit strong enough to rip apart a brick wall then get hit and fly back and then get back up and I didn't think anything of it. Then the episode would end and I'd turn on invincible and see regular humans vs super heroes getting decimated and would make falcon and the winter soldier seem sort of silly and unrealistic. 

That's my problem at least. Just released at a bad time and now I am reminded of it when I see marvel shows/movies and especially this one because it was the one that went on and on for 8 episodes about it.

Plus, you know... heroes often win not by being the strongest but because they exploit a weakness or have a clever plan. Just as an example, Iron Man deafeats Obediah who has a stronger suit because he solved the icing problem, and Ant-Man manages to defeat the Yellowjacket despite having less gadgets and no death rays.

Who knows how the fight will go, maybe he has to survive until this random scientist charges up an anti-hulk beam, attract him on a platform which will launch him into space or distract him until the new Falcon guy has activated all the bombs that will collapse the building and trap the Red Hulk into the bottom of the ocean forever. I'm just spitballing here.

They think just because it's all made up that nothing matters. Worlds have a sort of internal consistency to them, their own rules they go by, regardless of what otherwise fantastical things that are just impossible in our world may happen. 

For instance, you wouldn't expect to see Space Marines in Tolkien's Shire, any more than you would expect to see Gandalf appear in, say, Ender's Game.

In this case, we have a completely normal human with no known superpowers or abilities going up against a Hulk. He should just immediately get turned into paste by that universe's rules, but that would make for a pretty short movie.

(Side Note: I think Thor was supposed to be just as important, but his movies fell flat for me. He was more secondary than primary.)

This Multiverse Saga doesn‚Äôt have one central character/duo that brings everyone together. It‚Äôs just a lot of separate stories happening all at once, and occasionally they will intersect, but there‚Äôs no overarching thematic or narrative cohesion.

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because the Disney+ series have muddied the waters, the fact that Kang had to be dropped, or the fact that the new cast isn‚Äôt as captivating as the OGs, but it‚Äôs just really‚Ä¶ scattered?

I always assumed that it was the super soldier serum that gave Steve the strength, dexterity, and mental processing power to properly throw, ricochet, and catch the shield.

Sure, anyone can use the shield as a shield to block blows from a human combatant or throw it to someone else, but to wield it as a weapon should require something beyond normal human power. And while the vibranium does absorb a lot of energy, it should still require superhuman strength not to be blasted back by some extreme forces.

The idea that a random person can calculate the proper angles in milliseconds to throw the shield hard enough to ricochet off multiple targets at high speed and have it bounce back to catch it without being injured themselves or knocked backwards from the force cheapens the shield and the idea of the super soldier serum at the same time.",valentino_42,96

I was so excited to see Synchronic, as I've loved everything that Benson and Moorehead had done.

But the entire movie was:

*Weird shit happens*

[Mackie's blank stare]",Blametheorangejuice,3
Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"The Kinnaman body just a skin as the original Kovacs is of Asian descent and thus his internal identity. This sounds like an easy way to swap actors, but the skin concept requires incredible coordination and compatibilties between actors. We all still see Kinnaman as Kovacs.  A few scenes in his original body was not enough to break that association.

Many people struggle to watch the old  Dune films because the characters so often speak in prose, as well as have very important internal monologues. This doesn't translate to uninitiated viewers, and Altered Carbon's shifting internal/external identity focus is even harder to portray.

In the end, Kinnaman's brooding persona was far more defining for the character than Kovacs. The replacement needed to fit Kinnaman, not Kovacs, which is not lore-friendly, but what cinema expects. Mackie is far too known as a friendly, smiling, goofy guy. Even in Kinnaman's smiling and goofy roles there feels like an insincerity, maybe malice or pain behind the performance.

I don't want people to think I dislike Anthony Mackie. He's great in many of his roles. The character he was thrown into just had too much development on screen as a particular kind of presence. I wouldn't cast Mackie in a Nolan Batman sequel as the Joker, either. This is totally a showrunner problem.",AML86,2

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"> Then we have T‚ÄôChalla, who had one of the greatest introductions in Civil War, followed by a great performance in his own solo film. 

The problem with T'Challa was his best appearance was in Civil War. He actually had a character arc, one that tied into the whole theme of the film. T'Challa's realization at the end that revenge had destroyed Zemo, that revenge was destroying Iron Man, and that it was going to consume him if he let it. Not the most novel message, but it was well portrayed, and T'Challa felt like a pivotal part of the film when he could have just been another unnecessary side character.

In Black Panther, T'Challa goes from someone who wants to use Wakanda's technology to help the outside world to...someone who wants to use Wakanda's technology to help the outside world. Now you don't need a character arc for a film, but the film didn't seem to have T'Challa do anything interesting instead. Worse, it made him look like a hypocrite when he tries to through out his cousin without recognizing him as such, and then later starts yelling at ancestors for abandoning his cousin (never seeming to consider that he just did the very same thing).

And the same goes for his presentation as a superhero. Him being this extremely tactical fight in Civil War was awesome, and the first scene he's in really shows this - using his claws to go down the building, outrunning cars in the tunnel, the hand to hand combat, etc. Much cooler than ""your suit lets people beat you up and then you explode in a ball of energy.""",bnralt,67

Punisher has also gone up against Sentry and didn't get vaporized in half a second, which is also hard to believe.

The fact that so many people are hung up on this is making me feel insane. Are we not talking about a cinematic universe whose flagship character was literally a hero with no powers?


I'm not super hyped for this movie either, but I think most people would agree that it has more to do with the fact that the MCU has oversaturated the market with generally mid, homogeneous content for like 20 years, and there's no sign that this movie is going to try anything unique from a filmmaking standpoint.",IAmATroyMcClure,1

On one hand, the main part of the greatness that was the Infinity Saga was that heavily intertwined storyline. Without that, the culmination of both Infinity War and Endgame wouldn't have been as much of a cultural spectacle as they were. But on the other hand, as you make that intertwined web of stories bigger and include more and more characters that people don't necessarily even care about, you end up with people feeling like they need to watch through too much stuff they don't care about to keep up with the stuff they actually **do** care about. So they just stop watching all of it. I know several people for whom this is the case. For me personally the issue was the sheer amount of series that they started to pump out on top of that. I can't be bothered to watch series. It's just too long and requires too much of a commitment to watch the whole thing.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"While they do need a new anchor, I don't think that's the main issue. The MCU was great because each movie was an event. You had 1 or 2 movies per year which gave them plenty of time to focus on making the overall story good while also giving the audience plenty of time to be excited for the next one or to catch up on past movies. It also helps that they had a plan for where everything was heading. There were some duds here and there, but that's inevitable.

Then things started getting messy leading up to Endgame and since then it just went completely downhill. Now there's just way too much shit to follow, everything feels rushed, the writing has become so formulaic and frankly complete shit, they dialed up the quippy dialog to like 20, they're trying way too hard to bank on nostalgia to make up for their bad writing and at this point I doubt anyone at Disney knows what the hell their goal is.

So going back to your point about there being no anchor, there isn't one because the new content is so bad that nobody cares about any of these characters. They're basically just throwing a bunch of shit at the wall hoping something sticks but are seemingly refusing to just sit down, take a break and re-evaluate while the audience is just seeing a wall covered in shit.",This_Aint_Dog,2

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',18/01/2025,"The Multiverse Saga was never intended to be a centralized saga like the Infinity Saga was. Feige made a big deal about this and even said they were moving away from the Phase structure. But then everyone kept going on and on about ‚ÄúPhase 4‚Äù so they caved in. 

Marvel‚Äôs plan was to transition into a less loosely connected sandbox of stories like the comics, so people could pick or choose whatever they wanted to watch and Marvel had a little more freedom to experiment with their formula. 

The irony is that even though Marvel has largely stuck to that plan (quality of some the results aside), many fans fixated on the sheer amount of material and decided that if they couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt want to watch literally everything they would watch nothing at all.  

I also think part of the problem is that most of the MCU‚Äôs fanbase growth came during Phase 3, when they were on a super hot streak of films and everything was tying together frequently and in satisfying ways. Now they‚Äôve gone back to setting things up - with even more characters to deal with than in Phase 1 - and people are going ‚Äúwtf?? Where are the team-ups?

And Sam embodies the spirit of Captain America, but if we are seriously to believe that he could stand up to Red Hulk and survive then the audience doesn‚Äôt see him as cool, they see him as pushed.

Think of the enemies Steve fought in his movies: Red Skull, The Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. None of them are ultra powered like Red Hulk and even then, Bucky had him dead to rights. Steve is far stronger and faster than Sam and he would have died without Bucky remembering him.

The thing about Endgame and Cap standing up to Thanos is that he would have absolutely died as he was no match for Thanos alone; the Avengers bailed him out.

There is zero chance Sam dies against Red Hulk in this movie and he absolutely would if he did not have movie plot armor. This movie is kind of jumping the shark with Sam, a regular dude, surviving or even beating a one on one fight against Red Hulk. That kind of stuff makes him unlikable.",Gloomy_Slide,1

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"Sure, no one expects the character to be a political genius and lay out a detailed policy proposal. The problem is that, in the context of the story, the climax was ultimately the main character saying useless platitudes.

As far as we know, the Senators he was talking to *were* doing their best. We've never had anything in real life like the Blip, and it's not really clear how we would handle something like that. There are certainly no easy answers, and the show didn't even establish that those Senators were corrupt or bad at their jobs. Blindly shouting at politicians to fix all of our problems made Sam seem naive and moronic, which is not consistent with his characterization prior to F&WS.

It really felt like the writers thought that ""do better"" is some profound message. Compare to Captain America's speech in *Winter Soldier* and it's night and day:

> Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

In that speech, Steve Rogers gave his audience new information they didn't have, he had a specific call to action, and he summarizes the major themes of the film. It's an excellent speech and one of my favorite moments in the entire MCU.

But, unfortunately, the writers of F&WS just gave us, ""Do better.""",Realistic_Village184,27

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"I think maybe he does, we just didn't get a lot of moments of him being *truly* angry.

Avengers: influenced by the Mind Stone/sceptre; not *really* angry when the helicarrier stuff happened. But later during the battle of New York, he one-punches that giant flying slug thing and is an absolute monster during the battle.

Avengers 2: Mind-influenced once again by Wanda; not truly angry in his fight with Stark. The end battle wasn't really about strength itself (fighting a bunch of Ultron bots) so there weren't many showcases of anger-strength there. (Oddly he's absent for like 15 minutes straight in that final battle, one must just assume he was punching Ultron bots). 

Ragnarok: bested Thor and defeated Fenris while 'truly' angry, at the situation in general, but probably not 'raging'.

And of course Infinity War just had him being soundly defeated by Thanos (which was the case in the comic as well) and retreated after being beaten. And he might have already been in a different state of mind rather than 'anger' due to everything leading up to that.

The MCU movies are pretty cagey about power levels overall. Like, the Iron Man vs Thor fight in Avengers was cut short right before Tony was about to use his wrist-mounted tank-busting missile.",AnticitizenPrime,18

That's you and such a whiny little sycophantic weasel thing to say. Can't point out flaws in the billion dollar company movie slop or you're a hypocrite. 

No, if a movie wants to show what is more or less our world but with some extra stuff, that ""extra stuff"" needs to be explained. We know what humans can do. That's the baseline. That's why it was cool to watch Captain American chase down cars on foot. Or see Iron Man get in a metal suit in order to fly. Why they can do those things is explained and those explanations are important. Otherwise, the movie stops being ""our world plus extra"", it just straight up becomes ""alien world"", which is fine, but that's an entirely different kind of story.

- Cap: Red Skull desperately grabs cube and disappears. Steve gets through to Bucky via bro love.
- Thor: He outright states he can't beat Hela, but Surtr can.
- Strange: He bargains with Yourmamu. They reason with Wanda (blegh).

Killmonger comes off compelling because T‚ÄôChalla is politically uninspired and holds an extremely unsympathetic worldview. Killmonger wanted to change things while T‚ÄôChalla wants to maintain the status quo with zero introspection. 

Doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs not a super expressive character, meaning that unless he has amazing fight scenes and/or a really interesting ideology it‚Äôs hard to endear him to the audience and make him stand out. Killmonger got to be a firebrand revolutionary and Shuri got to be a cutesy joke-cracking genius who wanted to push Wakanda into the future. M‚ÄôBaku got to be the funny brute with his ultra conservative pro-Jabari stance while Okoye was the funny badass with a unique fighting style. 

T‚ÄôChalla gets ping ponged between new characters with vibrant personalities and a better developed sense of what they want for Wakanda and the world. He‚Äôs a far cry from the comic version and is an extremely passive character.

at least DC is NOT the earth we live on. gotham isn't a real city, or metropolis or star city etc. it's more believable when weird comic bullshit happens because they're not really trying to make it anything else. inconsistencies are... consistent? 

marvel tries SO HARD to push real world history and racial issues and other such commentary into some of it's content but then it wants the audience to just hand wave black widow taking zero damage from a massive explosion??? HUH? which in itself is CRAZY inconsistent with the hawkeye show where we see how clint is suffering badly from the wear and tear of being a human guy with no powers. he's pushed himself beyond the limits over and over and is kind of falling apart.

You can't have both fucking things. Is it more realistic to the power levels of the characters? or is it completely fantasy bullshit with plot armor all over the place?

I am interested to see what their plan is because toe to toe Red hulk wins easy. And given the content and context of falcon and Winter soldier we are to have the impression that Sam doesn't want to use the serum even if he had the chance.

The power suit he has isnt a hulk buster.

Somehow it *kinda* works for Black Falcon, a character that seems to have a bit of a stick up his ass and is otherwise just a basic-ass ""good soldier, better man"" that doesn't require much emotional range. But that sure doesn't mean it's fun to watch that character as a *lead* lol.",vNocturnus,8

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"Yeah, he wasn't Kovacs at all. 

But I won't go as far as saying he ruined the show.   The show was going to struggle no matter what because of the source material.  The first and second books are very different from each other.  The most consistent thing between them is Kovacs, but even then it's still a different feel to the character. 

The plot in S2 was book 2 and 3 mixed up with a lot of stuff removed.  But had they gone straight up with the book 2 plot, I'm really not sure how people would respond.  Again, it's a very different story plot wise but also in tone.  The first book and season have a noir feel.  The second book doesn't and a bit of that aspect of Kovacs is different as well.

I don't know.  The source material is not all that cohesive/not written consistently.   I didn't know this until after watching season 1 and 2 of the show.  But I went and read the books and then understood how the show went the way it did (in that they had a very uphill battle making a cohesive show if they were going to use the source material).  Not saying it couldn't have been better.  And totally agree about Mackie.  But I'm not surprised in the least after having read the source material. 

Honestly, I think it would have been best if they just ignored books 2 and 3 and built the show strictly off of the character building from book/season 1.  They maybe could have taken some background stuff or characters from the other books.  But should have just run with their own plot.

And they never should have changed the Envoys the way they did.  All the ""you're the last envoy"" stuff would make much more sense if the Envoys were what they were in the books.",sin-eater82,5

Maybe her aunt meant that no matter what happens, he has to try and persist in goodness even if it gets him screwed up and becomes hard which is a good and different message aswell and fits with the rest of the movie where he becomes angered but still everything happened cause he took 5 super villains in a room thinking they could play monopoly all together and idk why.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',18/01/2025,"Never said it was scripted. The ideas toyed around with were; 1. For the Falcon and the crew to die and 2. For Han to die. (And other examples of Luke turning to the dark side and dying etc etc. loads of ideas thrown around) It was proposed that a huge death(s) had to happen in the end battle for it to hold weight but was considered too dark a route to take. Han‚Äôs line was intended to suggest to the audience ‚Äúoh no, what will happen to the Falcon?‚Äù when in fact it would have been something will happen to Han, or as it turned out, nothing! Han was just paranoid. But these were all pre-production ideas, though evidence remains. And even during production Harrison still playfully poked Lucas into putting his death back on the table, but it wasn‚Äôt happening.

Another example of pre-production ideas leaving remnants in the final script was Leia not trusting Lando when they arrive on Bespin. Originally the idea was for Lando to have been a clone, and this was the basis for Leia‚Äôs mistrust, however Lucas scrapped that idea but didn‚Äôt see it as a bad thing for Leia to still not trust Lando anyway.

Incidentally, in hindsight, would have been kinda cool for Lando, a clone, to have been the one to blow up the second Death Star.",Eborys,1

This is a very safe message to promote, but looking at they way people have been reacting to a politically motivated murder of a CEO quite recently, many people seem more that ever desperate for meaningful societal change, even at the cost of lives.

Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"Why steve chose sam instead of bucky...

(1) ... Dialogue: Dr.Abraham Erkine to Steve Rogers (Captain America 1: First Avenger, 2011).

Dr.Abraham Erskine= ""Yeah, but... there were other... effects. The serum was not ready. But MORE IMPORTANT, THE MAN. The serum amplifies everything that is inside, so good becomes great; bad becomes worse. This is why you were CHOSEN. Because the strong man who has known power all his life, may lose respect for that power, but a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows... COMPASSION.""

Dr.Abraham Erskine= ""Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. THAT YOU WILL STAY WHO YOU ARE, NOT A PERFECT SOLDIER BUT A GOOD MAN.""

üëÜThis is the criteria Abraham Erskine (creator of the serum) set as the foundation for a Captain America when he CHOSE Steve Rogers by saying being a good man is ""MORE IMPORTANT"" than being a ""Perfect soldier"" (super strength, speed, etc like Bucky) whereby the serum only amplifies the good or bad in a person but it (the serum) is not the foundational requirement that defines who or what Captain America is and should be ""A GOOD MAN"" first and always. Basically an unshakable moral compass, pro-ethics and champion of optimism seeking to see the good in others first over how hard he can punch or how fast he can run.

In the source material/ comics, Sam became Captain America in 2014 (TEN YEARS AGO) and is still Captain America today.

(2) ... Bucky's Emotional Baggage:

 Bucky's experiences as the Winter Soldier and his subsequent struggles with PTSD make it challenging for him to take on the responsibility of being Captain America. The weight of his past actions and the guilt he carries would be a heavy burden. Steve Rogers did want that on him and also it does  NOT set him as ""ready"" to be the symbol for an entire nation and the world.

(3)....  Lack of symbolic Morality: 

Although Bucky has made significant progress in redeeming himself, he still struggles with the moral implications of his past actions as the Winter Soldier. Captain America's mantle requires a strong moral compass, which Steve Rogers embodied and Steve saw that more in Sam.

(4) ... Steve familiarity to Sam's Volunteer manner:

In Captain America 1:The First Avenger (2011), Bucky Barnes was actually AGAINST Steve Rogers joining the army. When Steve expressed his desire to enlist, Bucky tried to dissuade him, citing concerns about Steve's physical limitations and the dangers of war but Steve still volunteered to join the army even after knowing how much of a weakling he was (before the serum). And even when he was chosen, he was told the experiment might NOT be successful but Steve still VOLUNTEERED to proceed.

Dr. Abraham Erskine warns Steve Rogers (Captain America: The First Avenger, 2011).... ""We've had... problems with the serum. Unstable results. One subject grew too aggressive. Another... didn't survive.""

Sam Wilson is the FIRST person who is NOT connected or affiliated to SHIELD or any of the superheroes in any way to VOLUNTEER his help into active missions with Captain America and the Avengers. I repeat Sam VOLUNTEERED (Captain America 2: Winter Soldier movie 2014). Sam was NOT recruited like Nick Fury did to Tony Stark/ Ironman and he was not given command order like Nick Fury did to Black Widow for her to spy on Ironman/ Tony. Sam put his life on the line LITERALLY several times just to aid Steve.

Dialogue between Steve and Sam (Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)....

Sam Wilson: ""You need help, Cap?""
Steve Rogers: ""I'm not asking.""
Sam Wilson: ""Didn't think you were. When do we start?""

 Sam VOLUNTEERED the same way Steve did  to join  the super serum experiments and when Steve volunteered to join the army AGAINST Bucky's advise and when Steve Volunteered to save Allied forces POWs in Captain America 1 movie 2011.

(5)...  Steve familiarity to Sam's bravery:

Sam has shown bravery and resilience willing to engage physically stronger opponents like against mind tranced Bucky in CA2: Winnter Soldier movie AND in FATW tv series against terrorists who juiced up on super soldier serum AND will also face off against Red Hulk in upcoming CA4: Brave New World. The same heroic fearlessness Steve Rogers always had even BEFORE he became Captain America.... Remember the scene when scrawny tiny  Steve was being attacked by multiple bigger stronger bullies in CA1 when he said ""I can do this all day."" line when he had no super soldier serum enhancement?  

Steve recognizes THAT in Sam. That courage to face off against greater opposition without any extra powers or abilities just like when Steve was still a smaller weakling (before the serum enhancement) but he never cowered against far bigger stronger bullies.

Evidently, Sam focused his time, efforts and skills to doing good even in war he trained to RESCUE. Steve took an instant liking to Sam from the moment they met and that was BEFORE he even knew any details about Sam. Steve's instincts were right. 

(6)... Public Perception of Bucky: 

The world's perception of Bucky Barnes is still complex, given his past as the Winter Soldier. It would be challenging for him to gain the same level of trust and admiration as Steve Rogers, who was widely respected and admired. Sam Wilson does NOT have this problem.

(7) ... Different Values at the time of choosing:

When Steve Rogers was making his choice, Bucky's values and motivations are different from Steve Rogers. While Steve was driven by a strong sense of optimism, ethics, honor, and morality, Bucky's head was guided by a desire for redemption and personal justice and frankly the brainwash coding was not yet removed in Avengers Endgame so Steve knew Bucky was NOT ready to be the next Captain America making Sam the default logical choice.

The removal of Bucky's brainwash coding occurred AFTER Avengers Endgame in Wakanda as shown in Falcon and Winter Soldier tv series (2021).

(8)....  Steve familiarity to Sam regarding military RESCUES:

8a) ... Steve Rogers performed several military rescues saving soldiers and hostages during WW2.

Sam was an U.S military paraRESCUEmen unit (this is a real military division). This unit is also known as ""Guardian Angels"" in American military  (yes, this is for REAL)  who are the combat forces specifically organized, trained and equipped to conduct full spectrum conventional and unconventional combat RESCUE operations across during all phases of joint, coalition, and combined operations. as well as helping allies in all terrain including severely hostile situations. Basically a specializes unit performing rescues.

This is more heroic and closer to Rogers experience than being a trained assassin like Bucky even though it was not Bucky's intention.

8b) ... Additionally, the U.S military pararescue unit was created during WW2 which is the same time Rogers became Captain America.

8c)... It's also crazy amazing that the American military pararescue division are called ""Guardian Angels"" and Sam Wilson is literary a  military pararesuemen aka a ""Guardian Angel""  who is now Captain America.... A Guardian Angel Captain America is awesome AF in my humble opinion. 

In FATW ep1(Falcon and Winter Soldier tv series, episode One), we see Sam doing a military pararescue mission to rescue and extract a hostage.",Over-Distribution351,6

Look I don't know, maybe the movie's stupid and has a fight where Sam punches out Red Hulk and we're supposed to go along with it, BUT...

...in the MCU alone, he's not the first to face a vastly superior opponent and win not because he simply punched harder, or the first to face an opponent that could turn him into a bloody pulp, so I'm really not sure why people assume Cap will just steamroll Red Hulk in a 1v1 with no explanation.

The visual design is fantastic, and there are a few good moments and some great acting. The movie could've been fantastic, but ultimately the writing and direction just weren't great.",Realistic_Village184,13
Captain America: Brave New World,Official IMAX Poster for 'Captain America: Brave New World',17/01/2025,"Let's put it this way.

There's a character who can do illusions.  That's her thing.  She's somewhat childlike, or imaginative, loves storytelling, but is ""trapped in the body of a child"" and can't make a lasting connection with any mortal humans.

Except:

* The actress is clearly adult, or at least late teens.  She's small, but not *childlike* in appearance.  She could pass for early 20s with minimal effort and nobody would question it.  Picking a not-child-actress for the role is probably for the best considering the next few points, but I guess we can chalk *this one* up to suspension of disbelief.  So I guess let's pretend she looks younger?

* Current cultural norms and the age of consent being 18, ok, sure, she's probably not approachable by anyone with a healthy relationship in mind, *today*...

* But that's now, and not the, idk, 10,000 years shown throughout the movies as flashbacks, when many people got married at like 18 if not earlier

* Even ignoring that, *she has illusion powers*.  That's *literally her thing*.  

* She uses her illusion powers at the beginning of the move.  Like first 5-10 min.  To appear larger and more mature.  Which obviously can't work, because it's an illusion.

* Adult women come in small sizes.  Like 5' or less, especially depending on ethnicity.  She could just change her *appearance,* but not her *size*, and everything would be fine.  Sure, there would be a reckoning at some point, but with an illusion she could at least get past *casual contact breaking the illusion* before trusting someone.

Other characters form relationships throughout the movie/flashbacks, but her whole thing is that she *can't*.  Except her power set is *literally* capable of solving that problem if she just used her brain for 10 seconds.

&nbsp;

The whole movie is like this.  Things that are *almost* cool or interesting, and then just *aren't* due to terrible writing.

There were *multiple characters* in the movie just killed off seconds before they got interesting.  Like, here's a badguy or minion, hey wait, he's actually a complex character after all, this makes for a more interesting badguy, I wonder where they're going with this, it's a good moral dilemma.  Oh nope, dead.  Just killed him.  Whelp guess we'll move on to the *next* badguy?  I guess?",AlekBalderdash,5

They remove hulk for years, killing a romance arc dead in the water, they then give him another flirty, potentially romance (far fetched) with Valkyrie, they then strip that away with the events of endgame, after the whole awkward ‚ÄòI‚Äôm back‚Äô scene with Natasha, that due to the events of endgame served as a very poor way to re introduce him, just a ‚Äòhi guys‚Äô with no one really seeming to care because of the main focus being the wanda vision romance in that movie. They then break ALL of these potentialities by making him permanently the hulk, all while diminishing his role in the final half of endgame, while also killing off his once main love interest. And then they put him as a side character in a series with the ONE family member who he has had sexual relations with whether consensual or not and portray her as acting superior and more dominant then Bruce. Oh yeah and they turned him into a deli boy and changed his character from ‚Äòcautious scientist‚Äô to ‚ÄòTIME TRAVEL!‚Äô All off screen. 

My point is that they have done everything in their power to make his role in the MCU suck, and made him the side character in an otherwise unasked for series in the MULTIVERSE saga, which means that ‚Äòone off bad thing‚Äô can entirely be considered.

I had low expectations after reading the ratings, and I was still disappointed. I don't think anything was actually added to the main MCU plot. Sam continues to struggle to live under Steve Roger's shadow and his imposter syndrome persists. The ""main"" villain is such a side character, they literally have someone replace him as the villain in the last chunk of the movie, and he ends up just getting one final line in an end credits scene. The ""secondary"" villain of Red Hulk had like 5 minutes of actual villain screentime and then they defeat him by... talking him down? Joaqu√≠n Torres comically takes himself out but he was such a side character, that it was fine that he was gone for the second half of the film. The only redemption was seeing Bucky again for his short cameo, where he once again showed all the qualities and wise confidence that continues to make him seem more fit to have been the new Captain America in the MCU, instead. Sam was definitely more confident and embraced the title of Captain America much more smoothly in the comics, but in the MCU, I feel like Marvel failed to redeem him in this movie.!<",Heleners,5

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"We all saw this coming. Just for the record, I was never against Sam Wilson being Captain America. My issue was with Marvel ruining the idea of Sam being Captain America in the comics by making it all about his race rather than the responsibility of the mantle and what he's supposed to represent. They could've used his character arc to show the complexity of the military industrial complex and the toll it takes on soldiers since Sam is a military medic in the books. It's such a novel idea. 

In my honest opinion I had hope in Endgame when Cap chose Sam. I went ""maybe it'll be different in the movies"" cuz it absolutely sucked in the comics. Boy was I wrong. 

If y'all aren't aware, I highly recommend reading Ed Brubacker's run on Captain America with Bucky as Cap. You're probably better off checking that out.",joelbiju24,2

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,15/02/2025,"it's not a super terrible movie. it's definitely a comic-book story movie.

but, sam does aLOT of things that he shouldn't be able to,  unless he was a super-soldier/super-powered. his new sidekick seems a little too knowledgeable about his 'powers' already. the villain doesn't 'get away', for some reason. red hulk is too 'in control'. at least the movie wasn't terribly 'political', like the falcon tv show was.

it doesnt hold a candle anywhere near to the steve rogers movies. it doesn't do a great job of cementing sam wilson as the new cap. he has tech and doctors that you wonder how. the movie does things too fast, with stupidly high stakes (destroying the white house). steve rogers movies had terrorist attacks where he had to chase people, at street level, but he was a super soldier. sam is doing larger than life things that steve didn't, and he isn't a super soldier. 'he has technology'. who the f is giving him and maintaining this technology? he's shown to constantly act as some lone underground ex-patriot but who has access to literally everywhere.

the movie has issues. it does its job of advancing plots in mcu (mostly hulk-related). the characters displayed are never called by their known 'names', nor do they go as far as you'de think they would, compared to steve rogers movies. basically, MCU is being dumbed-down aLOT, either for little kids or because of horrendously worse writers.",4eye,2

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"I miss the good old days when DC movie fans would say that Marvel/Disney were paying off critics to give great reviews for MCU movies. 

When this was announced and spoilers started trickling in I thought it was legit stupid for them to have two Hulk villains as the antagonists for the movie, and to cast an extremely old Harrison Ford to be a replacement for another elderly actor that passed away. There are plenty of Captain America villains left out there, Sin - the daughter/genetic clone of the Red Skull - would have been a great villain for Sam‚Äôs first movie as Captain America. The MCU doing away with SHIELD and Hydra so early on was a mistake. So many of Cap‚Äôs, and Marvel‚Äôs, stories are tied to those two organizations. 

I really hope we get a nice reboot after Secret Wars and Marvel Studios doesn‚Äôt progress the movies‚Äô timeline along the real world timeline.

Which is kinda insane, this was announced in 21' and Thunderbolts in 22'. Marvel clearly didn't have as much confidence in them with how long it took to get them started and out. Guardians 3 (Jan) and DP&W (Sept) got announced in 22' too went through all their production and then released before either of them which is insane. 

Cap and Thunderbolts were caught in a weird place where they were too far along to just give up on but also not exactly fitting the new ""vision"".

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,">‚ÄúCaptain America: Brave New World‚Äù was never going to be a revolutionary text. But considering ‚ÄúThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier‚Äù at least made allusions to the Tuskegee experiments, the exploitation of Black bodies, and the prison industrial complex, there was some optimism this film would tie those threads together for a vibrant contemporary fabric. Instead, ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù clumsily wraps distant political themes around misshapen action set pieces for a film whose want to entertain overpowers any narrative coherence. These heroes stand for nothing, and as such crumble before our eyes as they try to safeguard a milquetoast future born out of a buried fascist past. ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù is the relic of a post-racial dream, built with respectability tools that have been not only ineffectual but self-destructive.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"When winter soldier came out, I was hoping for a more Cold War espionage feel. I felt like they missed an opportunity there to really do what the comics can do sometimes and play with genre and tone. With Sam not having super powers, I hope they are leaning into a more cerebral effort. It does not seem that way by these review blurbs. Although, it can be hard to trust them as well. 

When people make lists of the greatest comics they have read, they are usually more provocative, and a reflection or repudiation of the times they are written. They tend to have less action, (Watchmen, Killing Joke, Dark Knight Rises. Long Halloween, Hard Traveling Heroes.) They are more holistically compelling. What gets to me is that all of those examples have been used in one way or another to serve modern comic book films. They never seem to get it right because they don't trust the public to truly engage with anything beyond spectacle. 

We don't love these characters because they had an exciting, flashy panel where they uppercut the villain. We care about, their ideals, motivations, sacrifice, and response to the world around them.  We want to engage emotionally, intelligently and in some cases, more realistically than we are given credit for. The action scene is fun and certainly a part of what we are here for. Everything else matters a little more, if you want that action sequence to matter at all.

A studio sees a movie like venom make a ton of money and chases that ""high."" Spectacle sells tickets, but, ideas create passion. And passion will always find investment from audiences over spectacle. If you are ""brave"" enough  to trust us with it.",DarthKel,1

Hear me out- let‚Äôs start making Marvel movies about specific stories. Kravens Last Hunt, Marvels, Annihilation Wave, The Clone Saga, Earth X, the Phoenix Saga, just examples. 

These movies can exist in their own worlds, re-cast and utilize new eras too. Some maybe one movie, others could be a trilogy or two movies.

I was saying to girlfriend after we watched this movie was that kind of have an appreciation for Micheal Bay weirdly. He cgi monstrosity with transformers and all that but the shots themselves and locations were all in camera, the explosions were practical, at least most of them. Those movies, even with the heavy cgi felt like they took place in a real setting. It felt like the characters were actually in Egypt or whatever. ¬†

But watching this movie, I never once felt like the characters were anywhere but standing on stage in front of blue screens. Every single set felt completely faked. It‚Äôs killing any chance I have to enjoy these movies.¬†

Instead of the magic of combining cgi with real locations this movie just drop cgi on top of cgi and it looks terrible. I would get it if they were saving money, but they are spending way more on these movies than movies that shoot on location. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. ¬†

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,17/02/2025,"Outside of Harrison Ford, the acting was bad in this film. Anthony Mackie can't carry a film by himself and lacks the charm/charisma to hold the Captain America title. The actress who played the Widow character was unfortunately completely miscast - does anyone believe she, being maybe 110 pounds and 5 feet tall, would be able to take down a roomful of men herself, much less be able to adequately protect the President of the US from physical threats???

Also, the main plot point of some mad scientist being able to mind control others via lights flashing on phones and retro songs was never explained properly, not to mention one of the most stupid and unbelievable plot devices I've ever seen used in a film. It was completely unbelievable and just didn't fit at all with the supposedly somewhat realistic political drama genre Brave New World was leaning into, with the tensions between the US and Japan.

In terms of the positives, there weren't many: the aerial combat scenes were decent and the last fight scene with CGI Red Hulk was well done, though still not worth having to sit through a boring 90+ minutes prior to that payoff.

Captain America: Brave New World - 6/10. Director Julius Onah directed what is undoubtedly the weakest Cloverfield film in the series (The Cloverfield Paradox). After directing that film, I'm surprised he got another chance at making a big budget film. In a sad twist, he ends up directing the now weakest Captain America film. Now Brave New World is again, not as bad as everyone is saying. But, its also has little to no life at all. This is lukewarm to the core. There's stuff happening throughout, and though there's some big action set pieces and your usual kind of beats you find in a Marvel film, this just felt really dull. Anthony Mackie's first solo run as a hero is admirable, and I know he's tried really hard at making something out of nothing. Harrison Ford is in full Ford mode, and it just feels like an average performance from the man. What I was kind of anticipating through the trailers for the film was that this could've been a great political thriller genre film, within the world of Marvel. But that was really presumptuous of me, as obviously a genre film of that kind would never happen within the MCU. There are moments of the Manchurian Candidate popping in here, and there's moments of political conspiracy thrillers being here as well. But at the end, we are left with a film that is just there to add yet more lore for the franchise, and just give backstory to why Cap is the way that he is by the time we eventually get to the next Avengers film. It seems like the MCU is finally at the stage of diminishing returns. Last year's Deadpool & Wolverine seems like an outlier, and that movie only worked due to the anticipation and fun of seeing those characters and many others joining forces. Here, we get a bland villain, a bland overall situation, and just things happening that by the end, you just kinda shrug your shoulders and say ""well, I guess I can say I saw another MCU film."" It's one of those big budget, middle of the road films that you will never really look back in a fond way, but, will entertain you enough to forget the 2 hours of watching the film. Whatever is in store for the future, just know, it seems like MCU's eventual demise might be a little closer than we think. Okay I guess!",ViewsOfCinema,1

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,10/03/2025,"Junk. Mackie isn't bad or anything, he's just meh. Like a substitute teacher.  



When I was 11 years old I went and saw Batman Forever. I loved Batman and then I thought Batman Returns was decent but in both it really didn't matter because in both Keaton WAS Batman/ Wayne.  I remember looking at Val Kilmer and constantly thinking: "" Okay, he's not terrible for now, but when is the real Batman coming back? Maybe next movie? ""  (Then that Clooney debacle.)  I think the biggest issue is that with Batman, Captain America and Iron Man the superhero is the least interesting part of the movie.  It's the alte r ego that makes it. Keaton was Wayne, Clearly Downey is Stark, he's more Stark than Stark, and Evans was Cap.  Mackie just isn't. 



But in any event, yeah, the move itself was pretty trash. Bad writing and just a dumb plot. Thankfully its not that long. 



Get serious and just go pay Chris Evans,  Downey,  Hemsworth and Ruffalo (Also Tessa Thompson, most criminally underrated actress in the world )  a truckload of money and make ""Avengers, The Return : This time it's really the last one.

But the MCU film I really want to be great is Fantastic Four. Especially because the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee run is one of my favourite comic books I've read. I would describe Fantastic Four as Marvel's Star Trek in terms of cosmic space adventures that tackle some social issues, and is very focused on character and world building. And based on the teaser, it looks to be the most faithful Fantastic Four thus far. I want to have hope. Especially since it's one of if not the best Marvel comic that has been done dirty on the big screen so far. I would say it is ""the Marvel Comic"" in terms of importance and eventually everything comes back to Fantastic Four. See Jonathan Hickman's Fantastic Four runs that lead into his Avengers/New Avengers run, which culminated with 2015's massive crossover event Secret Wars with Doctor Doom and Reed Richards as the main characters. Also Doctor Doom is the ultimate Marvel villain in terms of resilience and always having a grand scheme. Not Thanos. Who compared to Doom has been in less comic events. Also Doom is a more complex character. 

Unfortunately I had low expectations for Captain America: Brave New World because it seems like a mismatch of different ideas/tones that it seems don't all work as well, despite likely the best efforts from Ford and Lumby. Anthony Mackie I personally find a dull actor. He has one emotion as Sam Wilson. Compare him to Chris Evans, who embodied the role of Captain America and showed more heart/emotion. I am all for Sam Wilson as Captain America and I'm sure there are comic runs where he is a great Captain America, and he is a better character overall in the comics. I just wish the actor playing him in the adaptation wasn't so pedestrian.",BryanDowling93,1

Boring movie. Boring lead character. Incredibly disappointing final showdown. The green screen is especially egregious. Marvel needs to do better for their flag-ship Heroes.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,15/02/2025,"I thought it was going to have to do something with Eugenics. I mean, in the 2920s to late 1930s, eugenics was all the rage in the west. Lots of thinkers were into the idea that the human body could be genetically perfected. In our timeline (the real world) that never happened. The Ubermensch, the Overman never really appeared. 

But in the MCU Steve Rogers existed, all the way back in the 1940s. 

I mean, there HAS to have been some sort of Eugenics movement boom after Steve Roger no? The idea that you could create a legion of super soldiers to do your bidding would have led to several cold war programs focusing on human-genetic modification. The Black Widows seem to be partially a product of that too -- as well as Isaiah Bradley. 

So, you have a film named Brave New World -- a book largely about Eugenics-- that...has nothing to do with Eugenics. Okay, maybe it should have something to do with large psychological manipulation...No?

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,16/02/2025,"I gotta disagree.  I got Winter Soldier vibes from this.  Government conspiracy, compromised agents, secret manipulators behind the scenes, etc.  I don't see how you can't consider this a government takeover when we literally have the president himself being compromised.  Plus, it wasn't some wild comic thing like he's secretly a Skrull or an alien, he kept a guy prisoner who wanted revenge, that's a very grounded and relatable motivation.  

Sure, Winter Soldier did it better, but I think BNW did it well.  Calling it Cap vs Red Hulk might as well be like saying Winter Soldier was Cap vs Bucky.  The end battle was Cap vs. Red Hulk, but most of the movie was Cap trying to unravel the Leader's schemes.  I think the scores its getting are a little low, to me it was an 8/10 movie at least, maybe even 8.5 once I think about it.  

I'm still getting used to New Falcon, I'm not entirely sold on his actor yet.  And it bothers me how the Leader said he had to turn himself in when his audio played during the president's address at the Rose Garden was pre-recorded, so that part didn't make sense to me.

I loved how they took a forgotten and panned movie like the Eternals and made it relevant finally, we've ignored it for too long and its reasoning that its finally back in the spotlight makes perfect sense: countries fighting over a giant pile of resources is understandable to most people as a motivation, and it salvages that movie somewhat that we're somehow going to get mutants and Wolverine from this.  

And I loved Giancarlo Esposito in this, he's really scary as a normal guy with no powers.  Sure, he was fighting Sam without his suit at the time, but it makes you realize how a lot of heroes are super vulnerable with a well placed bullet when they're on vacation.  I think the movie did what it needed to really well and is a good lead in to the Thunderbolts.  I can totally imagine the MCU's Congress freaking out about what happened and thinking they need their own version of the Avengers.",MelonElbows,1

They set up Falcon and Anthony Mackie up for failure with this one. Why is he captain America as a guy with no powers? It‚Äôs just kind of dumb when you think about it. Falcon has never done anything super impactful in the movies, and Disney along with everyone else knows it‚Äôs dumb to base their movies off their tv series at this point. It should have been Bucky, and maybe Falcon could have become the next Ironman or something that actually suits his character. Or at least give him a super soldier serum or something to make him more interesting.

But nope, he‚Äôs just a background character for 10 years, then randomly thrown into one of the two premiere Avenger positions after a mediocre tv series.

And his villain is red hulk??? Like I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some comic out there where Falcon fights Red Hulk, but cmon. This is like the most comically imbalanced casting of in universe conflicts possible lol

However, I think those movies had an identity to them that made them more appealing to a category of black viewers who don't typically pay attention to MCU movies. Cap 4 does not have that identity, it just has a black star and i doubt people will show up just for that.

Cinematography is garbage in these modern MCU movies. Like you said, everything is flat. It's like everything is shot on a smartphone w/ the white-balance dead-set on middle grey, and HDR set to maximum. 

It is not helped by the fact that they use so much green screen; and poorly lit green-screen, at that. Even in the most recent trailer; which should be polished; looks like shit. The backgrounds looks fake and like windows AI generated desktop wallpapers.

Eternals had a villain that was some primitive beast, but the more they fought it, the more it beat others, the more intelligent it seemed to get. It became an intelligent beast, then seemed to develop some sentience.

That was a really interesting concept. The bad guy gets more intelligent and more empathetic as time goes on, making it harder and harder to justify fighting him and making it more easy to understand his motives. I've not seen that before.

I thought they were going somewhere with that. Have the resolution be non-violent, or at least drag the viewer on the villain's side by the end. Or at least make us understand the villain's motivations or something.

They're also meticulous. I really think marvel is hiring good up and coming directors who really just aren't that interested in comics but ARE interested in the clout and paycheck of a marvel film. So much of this film just looked bad and that is entirely on the director. I do VFX for TV and was appalled by some of what I saw in this film. It just looked straight up bad. Like environments and destruction just looked unfinished. Like they got 70% of the way there and approved the shot. Awful. Sets looked too clean, or large, or contrived. Camera angles weren't super motivated or dynamic. It just all felt undercooked or like it was approached without a solid plan. Like the director was like 'sure thing do what you want' instead of 'here is my vision, here is reference we established, here is a rigorous story/shooting board that plans out the entire story and nails the color theory and cameras.

There was a time when the MCU was untouchable and could get away with subpar films, especially since they didn't release many ""bad"" movies in the heyday, I can think of maybe 4, but I think the days of them coasting on hype are done.

The superhero genre isn't exactly fine, and it will sputter out as all genres do, going from multiple films per year to one or two, but I don't mind if those one or two are worth watching.",Athanatos173,24

Captain America to me is always a World war soldier, whose out of his time. And someone whose 99% of the time morally correct and preaches what he believes, and because of this is highly respected by the other avengers/supes

Now bucky is definitely a world war soldier out of time. And he's actually had a redemption arc and had his morals challenged constantly, until he's actually become a respectable person, and he STILL has room for character growth which could've been expanded on if he picked up the shield (e.g. bucky isn't very social, and Captain america needs to be the voice and heart of the avengers )

And then you have Falcon, who isn't a world war soldier, is very up to date with technology (at least in the MCU), and has been captain America's yes man the whole time he's been on screen (meaning we don't know his morals, and we don't have any actual character traits which set him apart).

Well, technically, Ayer was a bit forced to add that line since in the comics, it's the prisoners themselves who sarcastically nickname the team as ""Suicide Squad"". The true name given by Waller and the government is Task Force X.

Moreover I didn't find it annoying, it's just only one few second forgettable line in fact. And It's crazy to ""officially"" name your team as suicide squad, nobody would want to join and the hierarchy wouldn't approve it (I suppose).

But since the two movies and marketing strategy, it's kind of weird because Suicide squad became the only and official name of the team in the comics universe, even Waller use that term.",CitizenTony,1

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"Eh. I don't know about that. Right now the R rating is a novelty for Marvel. If they start going harder into adult territory more often the novelty goes away and people get over it. Marvel comics have also typically been PG affairs as well so going R rated doesn't feel faithful to most of the characters and their histories.

Now, being mature with filmmaking doesn't necessarily mean an R rating... but I think the higher rating is what you meant.

I think it really comes down to characters. The ones people cared about are mostly gone. The new crowd are not as compelling, feel underbaked much of the time, and they're using C list heroes now nobody cares about beforehand. The original crop of heroes were ones EVERYBODY knew. If you took the poster from Avengers 1 when it came out my boomer mom could name all the heroes on it. Now with stuff like Thunderbolts they're sometimes focusing on characters that I, a millennial who grew up very casually reading Marvel comics, have never even heard of.

I think nostalgia is the only thing they have to rely on right now. There's the potential to do interesting things with the X-Men and I think an eventual MCU X-Men will be a big success. At least from my perspective as a millennial casual reader, X-Men was HUGE in the 90s and a lot of people have nostalgia for that, whereas nobody I know who was into comics ever cared about the Fantastic Four which I think is why they've been parodied to death over the years (I never cared for FF but I did think Ultimate FF was kinda neat, to a degree, at least the direction they went with Reed).",caninehere,2

The problem is that they've chased away anybody with real talent to work almost exclusively with hired help who just do what they're told and don't argue with management. 

The first few MCU films were made by Joe Johnson, Kenneth Branagh, Jon Favreau and Joss Whedon. Now they're being made by Nia DaCosta, Julius Onah, Shawn Levy...people with some mild pedigree but no real clout who are beholden to the studio. Depending on who you believe, DaCosta just did the principal photography on The Marvels and walked away while the execs and their company men edited the film. The directors are practically figureheads. There's no creative vision, no artistic integrity. It's a product made by committee and the scripts have the same problem.

There has been a marked effort on Disney's part to lighten up the MCU. Black Widow went from a cold blooded assassin who uses guns to Team Mom with an almost exclusively non-lethal fighting style.

I think it was an interesting strategy. They were trying to recreate the comic book experience in movie/TV form. With comic books, you have a ton of characters and plots with some crossovers mixed from other comics. Sure there are diehards who read everything, but I think the typical reader is just going to read what interests them.


I think Feige was going for that same idea in the MCU. Make it less about focusing on a single arc. Intentionally have different arcs and threads that impact different characters. In a way, that kind of makes it less necessary to keep up with every single thing. If you love GotG, feel free to watch those movies. If Thor shows up, feel free to pick up his comic or watch his movie if you want to know more. Otherwise, it's no big deal. Keeping track of the entire universe is less of an issue in the comics, and seeing a character pop in that you aren't familiar with also isn't a huge deal.


As it turns out, people really liked keeping track of the whole universe, and they really liked the feeling that comes with building to larger events.",mfranko88,4

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"They took a couple of major risks IMO.

First, there's the casting risk. Robert Downey Jr. was a very risky casting choice for someone who had to be one of the anchors of the entire MCU. In 2006 when he'd been cast he was *just* starting to mount his comeback. The biggest movie of his comeback to that point was probably Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which may have a great reputation at this point, but it was hardly making people bang down his door. On top of him you've also got Chris Hemsworth as a core member of the team, and he hadn't proven anything either. And this was back before you could say the IP was the real star--later on you could certainly have riskier casting decisions without worrying about them sinking it.

The other big risk was investing so much in the shared universe in the first place. It seems like an obvious thing to do now, but it risked creating a situation where people stayed away from movies because you needed to see so many of the others to understand them (true or not, there was a risk of that being the interpretation). Post-Endgame I think you can make the case that the risk here was proven as they've upped the amount of content to keep up with, but pre-Endgame they pushed it just the right amount--instead of staying away from movies because they didn't see the others, people went to see movies so they wouldn't get behind. But that was far from a sure thing.

I agree with the sentiment that most of the movies are average. But there was definitely risk involved early on.",astroK120,7

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"Which is a shame because Marvel should be a fertile ground for creativity, since the franchise comes with a starter kit. Like Star Wars games of the '90s and '00s - here are your basic building blocks, go and have fun. Obviously there were a lot of stinkers, but then there was some really innovative and cool shit that happened in part because there was a surety of having the licence and knowing you're going to sell a certain number of copies anyway. The flight sims were in a league of their own, Dark Forces was doing some really innovative tech for an early FPS, there were great third-person games, and so on. 

You've got the Marvel Starter Kit; here are the heroes established, here are the ones up for grabs, here's the major threat for this phase but you don't have to engage with it. X number of people are going to see it because it's Marvel. If the studio is worried, they reduce the budget a little, with a lower audience expectation.

The movie won't be a big hit, but it'll almost certainly make a moderate profit in the theaters (especially as it only cost $180M, which at this point is competitively cheap for an MCU film), plus it'll sell some toys and other MCU merchandise.

Before the keyboard warriors jump on me saying it‚Äôs just racism. Look at someone like Michael B. Jordon when he was killmonger. He commanded and room and had that leader presence. 

That is by far one of the biggest issues with falcon. He comes off as a bad version of cap. Yes I know in the comics him struggling with it was the big thing. Keep in mind also they brought caps back too in the comics.

They should have put him in a relationship and given him a child - a normal relationship and child - and then lose the mother and/or child. Cap as a father figure/protector of kids is a strong message and wasn't able to be explored with Steve Rogers (and would have given the MCU the option of off-roading Sam back to being just Falcon, that is for family reasons).

Agree, Thunderbolts looks surprisingly good - I think because the characters are all interesting misfits. Fantastic Four I'm hopeful for given the family focus of the trailer, but I'm not sure about.

Doomsday/Secret Wars is a giant disappointment in the making, I feel. It's currently lacking *everything* the previous big arc had.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"Seen him once *so far*.

I felt that the end to GotG3 was a massive letdown *because* they didn't kill the villain when by every right they should have. These are not character that are big on holding back for morals or some sense of higher justice or the like. They have a montage in the scene before of the team just mowing through an army of his goons. Rocket has every right in the world to blow the Evolutionary's brains out all over the deck after everything we saw leading up to that scene. Even if Gunn wanted him to not kill him outright, but to have Rocket take a moral high ground and see about bringing him before some galactic justice system, almost everyone else there would have done it instead. Peter would have done it because Rocket was his friend. Groot would have done it because Rocket was his *best* friend. Drax would have done it for the kids we saw earlier.

But what should have happened was that Rocket tries to take the high ground and spare the Evolutionary, starts in on the speech he gives in the film, only to be cut off when Nebula blows the Evolutionary's head clean off. Her and Rocket had also gotten extremely close, working as 2 of the surviving members of the team during the snap, so she cares for him at least as much as anyone else. She's also *very* familiar what what a Thanos-level threat looks like and that guy just genocided an entire planet of his own creation a few minutes earlier, so there is no way she'd let him walk out of there. Finally, it would have furthered her character arc of becoming the leader of Know Where, as it shows she can take charge and do whatever's necessary to protect her people.

The only reason I can think of for the Evolutionary not being immediately offed like that and instead left as a sniveling heap was that the suits in charge recognized they need a new big bad and he was one of the best choices, so they couldn't have him killed off.",Deranged_Kitsune,3

The early MCU gave the characters room to breathe. It wasn‚Äôt this breakneck pace of 3-4 movies a year plus a bunch of TV shows. Too many main characters, too many side characters that may become main characters, too much of everything. It took 15 years to get from Iron Man 1 to Endgame and Thanos was looming in the background for almost a decade of that. Ant-Man and Captain Marvel were added to the core group late in the run but it still happened in a more methodical way. This is too much, too fast.

This version of Cap is literally a dude that is a vet (never stated how good, only said he had 2 missions and was a pilot in Winter Soldier), I like Mackie and I'm not gonna lie, Marvel is my guilty pleasure even when they make abysmal shit, so I'm probably gonna see the movie anyways, but it feels like something is missing from his character...

For starter: we have no real backstory, with Steve we knew who he was and all of his past.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"My assumption is a combination of multiple factors, may or may not include the following:

* Many think Sebastian Stan is a better actor than Anthony Mackie, and that the latter does not have the charisma of the former    

* Bucky's run as Captain America in the comics in 2010 was (IIRC) more popular than Falcon's in ... I think it was 2014?     

* Falcon doesn't have the Super Soldier Serum, which some think is an important part of what makes Captain America so good    

* Racism - some people will not accept a black Captain America, and some people think America overall would never fully accept a black Captain America even if they personally wouldn't mind it. Probably both. Two sides of the same awful coin, unfortunately      

* America is - or was, idk - all about turning over a new leaf; starting over; the land of the free; the promise of the American Dream; etc. Bucky's redemption arc would be complete with him donning the shield, taking up the mantle to ""serve and protect"" the country that he was brainwashed to destroy

The answer is no for stuff like Black Widow, Marvels, etc.

To be honest, the notion of ""I'm not watching them anymore"" is just weird to me to begin with.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"But America does not have 'literal' Nazis in office though. It has people who definitely have the same beliefs and ideas and are also clearly influenced by Hitler and the SS, but they are not actual Nazis, they are American politicians and businessmen. They come from within the American system and their beliefs and actions are shaped within that system.

This is actually my personal issue I have with Winter Soldier's political element, it makes the top brass of S.H.I.E.L.D. into literal Nazis. As in, actual members of a resurgent Nazi party led by a assumed deceased German Nazi scientist secretly influencing the otherwise righteous American government. In this way it 'others' the issue, the American institution is not to blame, it's a foreign influence that no one except for the absolute highest ups (which doesn't even include Nick Fury) was aware of.

It kinda feels to me as a way that the film and viewers can go ""No, you see, it's not the American system that's the problem, it's the people from outside who try to influence it"". Meanwhile, actual political thrillers wouldn't be afraid to just straight up say ""No, it's our system that's fucked, it's not because of some sort of malicious foreign influence it's because our own shit is rotten to the core.""

Like, to me the ending sequence of Winter Soldier makes this empty political posturing quite obvious when it proudly shows that Sharon Carter is now joining the CIA as if that's somehow the better option.

Though even Winter Soldier's kind of murky political messaging is much better than what this ""Brave New World"" is apparently doing (or, for that matter, Falcon & the Winter Soldier which had an absolutely insulting political message at the end).

EDIT: And just to counter the possible downvotes: I do actually really like The Winter Soldier, I just think it's political side isn't as biting as it should've been.",JWitjes,2

They understood that we were growing along them and we needed more meaty, mature stuff. That's where they stood. Marvel hasn't done that. They were more gritty when they started. You had personal, rugged stories. Now it's all generic ""save the world"" storylines with no personal stakes.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"I think that Wandavision and Agatha All Along were pretty original and really dark for being part of the MCU but, the problem is, most people didn't give them a chance because they say they're too ""woke"" (whatever that means). 

Both shows have incredible stories, amazing cast and I hope they get to finish the trilogy. I really do.

I am mentioning them only because these are very well made stories, that are so good, that have great characters and amazing performances and still they are among the least watched MCU shows on D+ (Agatha having the lowest numbers, even lower than She-Hulk and Secret Wars).

So, when the MCU actually delivers it's considered ""too niche, too woke, too queer"", I guess?

I haven't watched an MCU movie since Multiverse of Madness and what they did to my girl Wanda was awful, but, I think everything ""witchy"" that's happened is also going to be another pocket universe? There is no way Wanda is dead but I don't know how they can redeem her at this point, and also don't see those characters in the same direction as the rest of the MCU, can't picture Agatha in her current form in a movie, lol.

VisionQuest is going to be very interesting if it gets made.

Those shows, Loki and GoTG3 have been the only things I have enjoyed from the MCU since Endgame.

Edit. DC don't have good movies (Except for The Batman and The Suicide Squad) but, they have great shows, like you mentioned, Peacemaker, The Penguin (a masterpiece), Harley Quinn.

And, I always recommend Doom Patrol on Max, it's absolutely fantastic, a complete deconstruction of the genre, if you want something dark and unpredictable, that's the show for you, it's a travesty and criminal that's it's so underrated, Max didn't do any publicity when it was on air, the cast is amazing and it wasn't cancelled, it actually has an ending and it's great.",CataLaGata,6

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"I'm going to hard disagree for one reason: there needs to be a full gamut of these films. You need movies that kids can go to and a select few for adults.

I feel like the MCU can run into a similar problem as the comics themselves have where they increasingly focus on their existing market and keep moving toward more mature stories, more expensive product and limited edition nonsense; eliminating the kid market that made them big to begin with.

I took my kids to a comic store once and the shopkeeper just wanted us to leave. Everything was for 16+ is what he told me. I know that's not true but the industry certainly has troubles making content for all age groups. I was reading my kids a comic once and it was largely fine until it abruptly pivots to a villain that's kidnapping girls for a sex trafficking ring. I should have pre-read of course but it was completely at odds with the rest of the run and struck me as incredibly tone deaf.

Older MCU fans should probably accept they're not the target audience anymore. I have nephews all in their late teens or early 20's and they couldn't give a rats ass about MCU anymore. They just aged out of it and even an adult oriented movie is going to be a hard sell for them.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"The Thanos through line definitely helps keep the original Marvel slate on track, but I think what really maintained the franchise engagement was the core cast of characters. The MCU is essentially a TV show, and post-Endgame, they‚Äôve failed to establish who the leading ensemble is for it. The first run had Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America as the lynchpins. Whether it was a solo movie or an Avengers film, we were seeing those characters every two years at most, and after Iron Man 2, it was closer to 12-18 months in most cases. They also developed recurring heroes like Black Widow and Hulk during that period who were able to move between the individual franchises to give the brand a sense of connection even when there were not Avengers films coming out. 

Compare that to the six years since Endgame. They haven‚Äôt built a focal point for the franchise. It‚Äôs going in a dozen different directions without any sense of who we should be invested in. Even hits like Shang-Chi and Black Panther are years removed from their last releases, and Marvel doesn‚Äôt have any follow-ups close to being ready for production. The fact Feige wanted to go multiverse right after Endgame instead of building a New Avengers stable is one of the biggest management flubs in recent Hollywood, in my opinion. Focusing phase 4 on assembling a new set of heroes to take the mantle of the Avengers should have the been the focus, closing out the phase with a New Avengers film. Maybe the post-credits stinger there starts to hint at the multiverse. Drop one, *maybe* two projects in phase 5 that involve the multiverse, while still giving the New Avengers team their own solo films and another standalone Avengers adventure. Then make phase 6 the all out multiverse spectacle crammed with nostalgia bait, building to Doomsday/Secret Wars. 

It‚Äôs mind-blowing how poorly they carried on from Endgame. Still seems like Feige has no clue what to do, he‚Äôs just hoping Fantastic Four and the return of RDJ will reinvigorate interest in the whole franchise, all the while he‚Äôs staying married to projects like Blade for seemingly no damn reason.",NeoNoireWerewolf,6

Other than the inventor, I can't conceive of why anyone in the cast would feel so strongly in favor of earth.

The nonsensical and entirely pointless deviant antagonist, the really weird scope, the entire failure to address the whole ""where were they when Thanos came?"" problem (they went out of their way to explain the Celestial was waiting for a specific *population* *size* and the Eternals were there to protect *that*.

So familiarity isn't exactly this issue, it's the character development. The base movies from the late 00s/early 10s really focused on development and emotion which created the success of the MCU. Look at GotG.. I was a casual comic reader growing up in the 90s, and these were some really obscure characters to which to dedicate a full movie, yet the story is probably the best of the MCU.. Hell even Deadpool was a Marvel comic sideshow. To build off that, look what Gunn did with Suicide Squad and especially Peacemaker...

It makes more sense that Bucky would want to shake off the Winter Soldier persona, since he was a mind-controlled assassin, but it makes less sense that Sam should have to give up the Falcon persona, a well-respected superhero. Thematically, Bucky should be allowed to move on rather than be tied to something that gave him so much PTSD. Sam has nothing to move on from.

Thor 4 also sucked, at least at the thematic version which made the Olympus pantheon a joke, making Gorr not a really interesting character as a result. Hela was still better even as an one-off.

Ant-man 3 was a waste of time, even when that time Kang hadn't been switched out, because he's simply not as intimidating as he should be. The best ""fighter"" got swamped by just ants? No lasting damage to Scott and his gang? Nah.

BP2 is probably better than CA4, but I really don't like adding in Iron Heart, basically unneeded.

It was a direct response to the grounded Batman movie from Nolan. You can see it in the first Marvel movies. Even Thor who is all fantasy, had a very grounded approach to it. They have the bifrost be some sort of wormhole and it works, taking in account that travelling by rainbow sounded ridiculous . They have a very personal, political aproach to his storyline. Even if he is a norse god, you can relate to it. You can see it happening in real life. After throwing those storylines away, we were left with more ridiculous storylines trying to find a purpose.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"This is something I had an issue with Brave New World:

The movie felt like a Cap story. It was about Sam picking up the mantle and seeing what he can do with it. I know we had Falcon and Winter Soldier, but that felt more like a transition phase, and we really only see Sam being Cap at the very end. Here we see Sam leaning into his counselling background and expertise, and you see him building relationships and interacting with others. I'd say the movie had A LOT of heart. You see everyone really enjoying being around Sam, that they like him and respect him. They accept him as Cap. Yet he still struggles with the weight of the responsibility because he's not Steve. He's overall fine with it, but every now and then a doubt comes into play. His friendships are awesome. Him and Joaquin, him and Bucky, him and the soldiers. All of them. 

But the movie lacked serious weight. Not sure if it was a lack of time due to the reshoots or just poor sound from my theatre. The first act felt too light. Nothing had weight. Nothing was heavy. I don't expect Sam's regular punches to knock someone out, as he's not enhanced, but I expect his suit to give him a HUGE advantage, and it didn't feel that way. 

I really wish they go back to more practical effects to give that weight.",teh_fizz,1

Look at Gunn's shakeup of the DCU, they have kid focused shows and movies (Teen Titans, new Superman, etc.) and movies/shows for adults: (Emmy-winning) The Penguin/The Batman, Peacemaker/Suicide Squad. Hell, look at the critical success Invincible is having on Prime that is killing it with the 20s age demo.

The movies were all leading up to Thanos showing up and the Infinity Gauntlet arc being adapted in some way.

Also, the marvels was a super fun movie and got dragged by the first movie.  It alone was fun, and a solid popcorn film. Also Ms Marvel was a great show.  Shehulk was about as accurate of a comic book movie character wise as they couldve but it pissed too many people off and was allright, I wasn't a huge fan, but I also don't like the 4th wall breaking characters as much, (dp, gwenpool, shehulk, etc)

This film is unfortunate, but I do think Marvel had a few blows that have kind of nuked where they wanted to go.  Chadwick dying reallllly fucked up their plans IMO.  And the hate towards Brie, was questionable at best.   Then after all of that, Kang ran into the legal issues so they had to scrap again.

My honest opinion, the only actual dogshit thing marvel has produced since end game was Secret Invasion, maybe quantumania as well, but that was atleast funny?  Secret invasion legit pissed me off, Im a huge shield and espionage fan.  Everything else has either been decent action/comedy films.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"> I'd rate Endgame probably at The Joker/The Suicide Squad level but that's kinda it.

That was the weaker of the two films.  Infinity War was much better, which is why I think you just prefer DC.  

But also, I truly believe if Marvel took a DC approach where they told a story about a hero that was completely removed from the hero universe, they could make ""quality"" as you call it, films.  The problem is, talking in universe, you run into messy story arcs.  The dark knight works, because it is just a dude with money who dresses up.  Superman can't exist in that world, let alone any of the other magical or super people.  Bane was about the farthest they could go, and he was just really strong.  The batman was good, I really enjoyed it, but its a similar thing, unless something changes, you are telling a noir story, not batman.  Realistically though, the best batman movie was the first one.  I thoroughly believe that Heath ledgers death skewed how well it was perceived.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the Nolan trilogy, but I also love super heros in general.  

The jury is still out on if DC can figure it out, but god I hope so.  Competition will only make the two studios better and they both have a ton of material that WOULD translate extremely well to film.  I really hope Superman does well, Fantastic 4 and Thunderbolts look really good so far, and Cap4 seems to have been pulled in 90 different directions, which is a shame.  Still don't know why they made a tv show, then didn't have the other half of the tv show in the movie.  Bucky as Whitewolf couldve been sick.  Captain America and White Wolf",bryangoboom,2

I thought the avengers infinity war and endgame were up there with the dark knight trilogy. 

Also, what other DC movies were really good besides the dark knight trilogy? Man of steel and Aquaman were okay. Wonder Woman was overrated in my opinion. Their sequels were horrible. They definitely did not match up to Marvel‚Äôs recent prime

Intent is usually hardest to prove in a genocide case. South Africa has already made the case for Israel's genocidal intent before the ICJ -- so far from being impossible, it's already been done. If the ICJ exonerates Israel that doesn't mean Israel didn't commit genocide (see Serbia and Srebrenica). But we have no reason to think the ICJ will exonerate Israel given that they've already found Israel is plausibly committing genocide and have issued several provisional measures to Israel, which Israel hasn't taken.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"It‚Äôs crazy to me how doggedly the studio has pushed to have all their shows and movies more or less look and feel and sound the same for the sake of brand synergy. I can kinda understand that they want audiences to be able to tell immediately when they‚Äôre watching an MCU film, but right now that manifests only because we can immediately tell it looks like over-produced, over edited, sterile slop.

And meanwhile, like you said, they‚Äôve had so many big name writers and directors pass through their doors and they really haven‚Äôt allowed any of them to actually put their talents to use freely and leave their mark on the final product.

I‚Äôve been rewatching some of the DC Animated Universe lately, and just recently got up to World‚Äôs Finest, which was the first time that Batman and Superman crossed over in that continuity. Both these shows had a lot of the same people working on them, and I assume there was always at least the idea of making them into a shared universe, but they still each have a very distinct visual style, and it‚Äôs *because* of that pronounced individuality that the crossover works so well. The Superman opening credits play, but then it opens on a blood red night sky and dark, looming gothic architecture and *immediately* you go ‚ÄúOh, shit, that‚Äôs not Metropolis!‚Äù and realize that you‚Äôre in for something special.

Seeing the different worlds and styles come together and clash is what makes crossovers so fun in the first place. When they all look and feel the same to begin with then it‚Äôs really not that special at all if Simu Liu happens to show up in a Hawkeye movie instead of a Shang Chi one.",Wolf6120,31

And then it was lame.

In general superheroes are a bunch of reactive pro-status quo characters. Then, you have interesting villains because they are proactive. Then, you sadly get a cartoonish ridiculous version of the villains causes/purpose/action (can be one, can be all) which ends up being stupid. Like Thanos' Malthusian stupidity. The biggest bad of a 10 year of movies project was... an idiot alien without basic logic and that who didn't see the idiocy of his plan? Damn.

That's something that was good with the first Ironman movie. The villain was the reactive one. The protagonist was Tony who after being kidnapped wanted to CHANGE things and Obadiah tried to keep them the same. Nice superhero writing.

That's why Thor worked but not the sequel then again 3 worked for the same reason and 4 fell flat for the same reason (amongst others). Captain America movies balanced this nicely despite Cap being pro State. He usually wants not just to keep things as they are, but to make those better/correct them, so has a bit of both sides. Same problem with ironman 2 and 3. By then there's a new status quo established by Tony's actions and now he's just passive.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"I'm more annoyed with how the hand ninjas got around Daredevils powers. They mask their heartbeats to prevent him from hearing them, but it's shown in season 1 that's not really how he sees. Ignoring that, later on Stick tells him to listen for their breathing as a way to get around. But their breathing should be louder than a heartbeat, why would he not have heard it before.

On top of that, in one scene where Daredevil, Stick, and Elektra are fighting the ninjas, Daredevil literally is grabbing and punching one, then they turn off the lights and the ninjas are gone. How would turning off the lights change anything for the 2 blind people? You could say they masked their heartbeats the moment the lights went off, but this doesn't make sense considering Daredevil was literally grabbing one.

In regards to Elektra. I'm a big fan of her in the comics, but I don't think Elodie Yung did her justice. It never felt like she commanded any of the scenes she was in, and I think her on screen chemistry with Charlie Cox was just ok. Deborah Ann Woll and Charlie Cox had far more chemistry in my opinion. Overall I think she was fine, she just wasn't great.",SigiSeaver,3
Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,12/02/2025,"I'm not sure if I accept that you are saying something ""without asserting quality"" when you're arguing with me when I assert what I find to be high quality.

But also, I really strongly object to you conflating critical reception and box office return, which are often very different. Particularly when measuring gross financial return, which is measuring both audience expectations and the popularity of the genre, as well as a bunch of other marketing forces. Thor: Love and Thunder out-earned Logan by $140MM. Is Thor: Love and Thunder a better movie than Logan?

In reality, even limited to critical reception (which, to be clear, I was only ever talking about my opinion, but is the closer metric to relevance) the structure of the movies don't lend themselves to this comparison. Endgame is a giant spectacle, but it's also the culmination of the MCU up to that point. People like a team-up, people like a climax, people like better-written stories with better actors, and better characters (I think people just fundamentally like Spiderman more than most other heroes). I certainly am not saying that the **entirety of the quality of a movie** is how much of the action is street-level.

...I'll also point out that Black Panther is a mostly hand-to-hand, normal fighter, not a magic laser beams fighter, and has the highest critic rating overall of any MCU film, but won't use that to justify my point, because I don't think the quality of the action is why it's so highly rated.

You can't use a composite metric and then assume that they are also an ordering of all the qualities those movies have for every metric within that composition.",OneBigBug,5

Kind of but not for long. Phase 1 was largely journeymen directors with television auteur Joss Whedon rounding it off. Phase 2, while bringing in more pronounced directors like Shane Black and James Gunn, this is not only when they went towards TV directors and really fresh indie directors, you also see them starting to freak out over any bit of online complaints (like the whole Mandarin bullshit three people got mad at in Iron Man 3) and capitulate to it completely. But I will say some TV directors were better than others like Alan Taylor and the really good lighting in that one scene in Thor with all the candles vs. the incredibly hacky and concrete grey drab of The Russo Brothers. Why was the entire last hour of Endgame mud brown? God they suck so much.

>MCU instead of just solely being a vehicle for some plot contrivance of the overarching MCU bigger story.

From a marketing standpoint it *helped* I guess but it makes them age like milk as actual movies when just slapping the Marvel Studios logo on the poster should've been enough. I've read my fair share of Marvel comics, I like how different they can be even within the same book when the creative team changes. It's the appeal since they aren't allowed to end. I genuinely think the MCU has 10-12 or so good projects, which sounds great until you realise they're at 45 or so atm lol.

>Both these shows had a lot of the same people working on them, and I assume there was always at least the idea of making them into a shared universe

Same creative, specifically creative, people crossover into both shows would make sense when their are more similarities and ease of crossover. Like Kirby and Ditko did a lot of the early Marvel Comics stuff, it stands to reason why it felt like there was a similar style until they expanded.

>Seeing the different worlds and styles come together and clash is what makes crossovers so fun in the first place.

It feels the writers are saying, ""you should like this character,"" versus, ""Lemme show you why you should like this character.""

For the former, a good example is Iron Heart from BP2. The film says, ""Well she's a super genius as a teenager and made her own suit with a box of scraps. Way better than Tony. She's so cool. Like her."" As an audience member, just giving a checklist of how great she is not going to make me care about the character. In Iron Man, they made me hate Tony Stark. He was an awful guy but we saw him grow better as a person. Which makes us like him. There's legwork being put in. 

Another result of just wanting the audience to like these new characters as a brand is that they come off as too shiny. They're way too nice and quippy.

Those issues being the Covid pandemic, Chapeks disastrous two year run as Disney CEO, the massive strikes (by the writers, actors and directors guilds) in 2023 and the fact that Marvel retired several of their MCU mainstays in Endgame and basically had to start over establishing a new stable of main MCU leads. The only one of these that was completely out of Disney's control was the Covid Pandemic, and Chapeks god awful plan to steer the company out of it by rushing as many Marvel projects out as fast as possible to bring in cash (and boost Disney Plus's subscriber numbers to push it into profitability) did actual damage to the franchise. Phase Four was the largest MCU phase by far (7 movies and 8 tv shows) and it was crammed into less than two fucking years. Phase One was 6 movies and zero tv shows and it was spread out over five fucking years.

Sam would get priority in developing relations with supporting characters, in interacting with villain and antagonists, in screen time, etc Just like we saw with Steve Rodgers films mostly and like we saw in FATWS. 

Best Bucky could hope for is a Black Widow in Winter Soldier type role.

Which is another thing, I suspect the reason for not putting Bucky in this film was to test whether Anthony Mackie and Falcon can actually lead a movie on their own. Marvel knows Bucky is popular, Bucky‚Äôs had his own fanbase since Winter Soldier, and Bucky fans have been raging about a solo project or lead role since endgame, and Sebastian Stan himself has his own gaggle of fangirls.

Any one of them could conceivably be the new BP and I think the movie gives you a glimpse of the sister's journey but it's not enough.

The problem is that literally every one still has a big part to play and IMO the movie suffers for keeping them all in.  They should have just let the sister plotline drive the entire movie, maybe keep the bodyguard.  But Riri getting armor and BP's wife's screen time should have been cut way back.

Feigh said they all realized these Marvel movies required MacGuffins, and the Infinity Stones could replace those MacGuffins.

> Marvel had originally introduced the Tesseract in¬†Captain America: The First Avenger¬†to add a sci-fi element to the period piece. ""We then started to build the Cube into the mythology of the other movies,"" Kevin Feige told¬†Syfy Wire. ""We started to realize that *a lot of these films required MacGuffins like the Orb in Guardians of the Galaxy, the scepter in the first Avengers film.* And the notion that all of them could be a Stone started to come about right around the time Joss wrote that little tag in Avengers 1."" The studio began to consider Thanos as the greatest villain of the MCU, and by 2014 could announce a Phase 3 slate that would take them all the way up to¬†Avengers: Infinity War.

Whedon stated he introduced Thanos as the driving force behind Loki on Earth, but not as some overarching Infinity War plot, but just because he felt Thanos was his favorite villain and he'd be the correct villain to be ""behind all this.""

The first movies were aiming towards the Avengers. After the success of that movie, they clued in on Infinity Stones as MacGuffins, Thanos had been introduced as the Bad Guy by Whedon, explicitly retconned the Tesseract as an Infinity Stone in Thor: Dark World, and *then* planned the build-up to Infinity War.

Tldr; folks went to see their characters. Infinity Stones weren't a thing until after The Avengers.

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"> I think they don't do the legwork because the writers thinking that DEI is inherently interesting. They think that Iron Heart is interesting because she is super smart, basically a kid, from a low income area, and not white.

I wouldn't say that DEI is the appropriate term here. There is an intentionality in the writer's room to push characters of certain races and orientations but that's not really bad. What's bad about these ideological pushes is that it's a really bad place to start writing wise. 

When a writer wants to create a character that they perceive to be under represented, the basis of the character doesn't start with, ""What's interesting about this character?"" Instead it is, ""Wow, how can I get people to like this new character?"" So with these new """"""""DEI"""""""" characters, they typically come off as boring because the writer really wants the audience to like them. But, you know, conflict makes a character interesting and often times these writers avoid giving these characters real flaws. 

In a way, the more a writer cares about the superficial diversity aspects of a character as a selling point, the likelihood the character being boring will increase.",varnums1666,7

Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"No. By referencing GenZ I only mean new eyes. Because a lot of Disneys IPs have been so thoroughly digested for 50+ years in dome cases when GenZers see the OG trilogy, in my experiences, nieces/nephews etc. , they recognize the beats but find them boring silly. 

No sir. I‚Äôd say the biggest things for genz and younger are in a different medium. Skibidy toilet and others like it are attracting kids(new eyes) by the millions. Kids arent being offered new content/characters so they went and found them. Im sure in about 20 years we‚Äôll see treatments on these ideas. 

Seeing as Disney owns 20%+ of the market I‚Äôd say theres really no incentive for them to change the formula but again thats not what we‚Äôre talking about.",Fetal_Release,1

The truth about that subject isn‚Äôt welcomed here, and you know that. The fact that you call people like J.K. Rowling *fascist* is all the proof anyone needs that nothing you say is logical or reasonable. I‚Äôll just leave it at that. üòÇ",HPW3_222,2
Captain America: Brave New World,Captain America: Brave New World - Review Thread,13/02/2025,"I don't really understand what it is that you're arguing or what you want.  Surely you want films made that interest you personally so on that score I don't know why you're worrying what Gen Z thinks ... but in either case there's plenty out there to suit all tastes.  MCU is always gonna do what Marvel does, and that's throw tons of content out there, some of which will stick and some of which won't - I've been reading comics for years and can assure you that 80% of superhero content is drivel, why would the movie strategy be any different?  Yet, despite the recycled nature of Superhero stuff, the nuggets really shine through.  Like it or not Star Wars is also a very comic book-esque style property and that's gonna go the same way.  There are a surprising amount of absolute gems in the Disney Star Wars era, so it baffles me that people complain.  Not all of it will work for everyone and that's just fine.

  
But if this sortof thing isn't your thing ... then don't watch Disney stuff.  Honestly there's an absolute TON of other independent  stuff out there... one could lamost say we're in a golden age of cinema.  Just watch a bunch of A24 stuff for starters.",juss100,1
