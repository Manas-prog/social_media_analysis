Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"I wonder if the film would have been better if it had cut the alien bug plot entirely. There was more than enough going on to fill the movie with a plot before that became the focus. The morality of human printing, the cult of personality with Ruffalo, Mickey's multiples and a desire for revenge/justice. It's clear that much of the film is meant to be caricature and a little surreal.

I really enjoyed the performances and cinematography. Gave me vibes ranging from Avatar to Everything Everywhere All at Once to Nausicaa. Not super original in terms of its ""message"" and certainly not subtle, but worth a watch for anyone that enjoys watching movies! At the end of the day, that's what matters.",ZombieShot078,488
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"I know everyone is focusing on Mark’s character, but a really important part of the story for me was Mickey 17 and 18. The split parts of one self. I’ve been reading about IFS and how people have different “parts,” and the scene where 18 tells 17 he isn’t responsible for their mother’s death really hit me. I think as humans a lot of us carry around guilt like that and we might have another, more rational part of ourselves that knows it isn’t our fault but that’s hard to internalize. 

I do think this movie wasn’t quite as tight as other films by Bong Joon-Ho, but overall I liked it. The dinner scene is another standout moment for me.",saltybirb,1733

But to me, the film needed some fat cut. A good half hour of the film was totally unnecessary, with character blurbs and quirks that are tied up way to quickly or are hardly/ever addressed at all. Cut a few scenes and tighten others up, and it would be a much better picture. And Mark Ruffalo overstays his welcome as the bad guy. If you're going to have a bad guy be THAT annoying on screen(and Ruffalo does a great job in being so!), you have to use him in moderation. Have him around long enough for the audience to hate his guts, but not so long that we just want him to leave the scene one way or the other, dead or alive.",greenpill98,571

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],10/03/2025,"The more I think about the movie the madder I get. So much potential wasted. 

Probably the biggest headscratcher for me…why were the stakes so inconsistent? 

The film sets up that multiples are in abomination and will result in permanent deletion (the flashback as to why this is was super cool and fun btw). 

But Mickey 18 never seemed concerned. He wanted to kill 17 but their rivalry was forced and never really explored. 18 had such a distinct and strong personality and the film never really explained why they were such polar opposites. 

The film sort of forgets the whole “multiples” thing and every character just accepts that there are two Mickeys. 

Especially his girlfriend. His girlfriend is not at all mortified or extremely concerned that her boyfriend could permanently die. I understand she is high during that scene, but cmon. Also, she found out that Mickey had multiples offscreen? Why rob us of that moment?

Also also, what the fuck was up with that dark haired chick? She was grieving her friend (girlfriend?) one minute, stood up to Mark Ruffalo, then tried to fuck Mickey (even though she’s grieving her…girlfriend?) finds out about multiples, tries to coerce herself into a poly relationship, kills the critter (so she’s bad again even though she stood up to Mark Ruffalo) , disappears, and shows up at the very end with a girlfriend.

It’s messier than Parasite, but somehow i found myself so compelled with the true conflict of the film and almost emotional by the end.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"I think I would've had a much better time with this film if I hadn't read Mickey7 and Antimatter Blues going in. Those books take complex philosophical debates on the nature of existence and boil them down into means accessible for a wide audience. We get to really grapple with the darker sides of humanity causing this mission, the interplay of religion and morality, and an overall question of what it means to be sentient and what form that takes.


To sum it up this way, the core of Mickey7's themes is the concept of the Ship of Theseus paradox. If Theseus has a ship and across his voyage, he replaces each plank one at a time over a 12 year journey, is it the same ship when it reaches the end of its trip? Same applies to Mickey and his bodies. And to our bodies over our lifetime. The concept never comes up once in the film.


As for characters, the film strips out almost all of their complexity. The Creepers, once a ""hivemind"" with complex social structures and genius intellect are reduced largely to animalistic talking bugs. Berto, now Tino, goes from Mickey's best friend who ends up in conflict with him for ""leaving him for dead"" as well as a skilled pilot and team member to a comic relief with a gambling problem. Mickey 17 and 18 go from similar if different enough versions of each other to Jekyl and Hyde personified reducing any sort of question on who is who. Nasha and Kai largely survive their adaptation but Kai never has her loyalties tested like in the book. 


And then, there's Marshall. Who in the books is a competent, calculating military leader whose finer judgement is sometimes restricted by his oppressive religious beliefs and bigotry, but is still overall potrayed to care for his colony is now a Donald Trump wannabe with Mark Ruffalo going full Baldwin in SNL in the role.


Now, I am the furthest thing from a Trump fan, but I see his mug on my TV, phone and feed almost every waking hour of the day. And this portrayal, as well as the resolution to his character and the conflict he brings, feels almost trapped in 2016, adding very little to what we've already seen in tens of other Trump-coded villains. And replacing the Marshall we got from the books with him is easily the biggest downgrade of the film, even if Ruffalo is clearly having a blast.




Now, all of this being said, this is still a Bong Joon Ho film and he's a damn great director. The camera work is stylish. The effects integration nearly seamless. The performances are strong across the board. My issues with Mickey17 really come down to Bong as a writer. Most of the jokes did not land for me and the choices made in adapting the story mostly worked to its detriment in my opinion. I really wanted to love this but as is, Mickey17 is much like its name, bigger, but not exactly better.",DeoGame,374

I'm kind of lukewarm on it, TBH.  I loved the cartoonish Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette characters, the gonzo energy, and I did laugh several times, but while it seems like it's trying to make some kind of higher points, the plot is a mess and it's overly long.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"My take on the movie.

Mickey is a person who completely rejects himself, which is why he's the only one who decides to be expendable. That's why everyone is so astonished - only someone who rejects themselves would accept such a position. Yet at the same time, it's the only way he feels useful to others.

During the first part, we simply see a loop of what has always been his life: a series of misfortunes.

Mickey 17 believes he doesn't matter, that he's a wretch. But curiously, everyone knows who he is. And everyone wants to know what it feels like to die, since none of them dares to live life the way he does.

He meets Nasha, experiences love, sex, caresses, and attention. For the first time, he exists for someone. Sex is the only place where he can be himself and feel free.

Then comes the first important part of the film. He doesn't die when he should. He assumes it's because his body must not taste good, that he's not even good enough to be eaten. At that moment Mickey 18 comes into action - his complete opposite. Someone with a high-pitched voice, decisive, carefree.

The fight scene is a turning point. It's where life puts before you the decision of whether you want to change and start living or remain as you are. Mickey 17 decides to fight, showing that he wants to live, that he doesn't like the life he's living. That's why he tells the girl that even though he knows he'll be resurrected when he dies, he's always afraid. And someone who has truly accepted that they don't want to continue living wouldn't fear death.

Nasha is the expression of love. When she decides to have sex with both versions, she shows that she loves him in both forms. That she accepts him just as he is. For this reason, she also doesn't want to share him with the other girl.

When Mickey 18 learns how the governor has treated Mickey 17 and nearly killed him, he goes crazy. He starts to berate him about how he could allow himself to be treated that way. 18 is that inner voice that appears when we begin to realize we can't continue living the way we have been.

At one point, Mickey 17 realizes the creatures didn't reject him because he wasn't appetizing. They saved him because he deserved to live.

In the end, he destroys the machine. He has to do it himself because the machine is what ties him to his past, to who he believed he was. But that Mickey 17 no longer exists. And that's why at the end he says he's no longer afraid of nightmares.

I don't know how much of this makes sense, but it's what I felt watching it. In summary, it would be like: ""Until we accept ourselves, we cannot live fully.""",FreshkyFresh,52
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"There was soooo much exposition in the first act. From the narration to the newscaster, it was distractingly poorly written. Pattinson was amazing though.",pet_dander,26
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],12/03/2025,"With all due respect, I hated this movie, and I hate that it turned out to be what it is, because it had high potential.

- Mickey keeps getting asked what death feels like, and this is an important poinnt. But.... he never dies at all. They scan his brain and memories once a week and if he dies they make a new clone. He never experiences death; the version that dies stays dead and the new version only remembers up until last week's scan. He never felt what death is. This is completely ignored by the plot, like he actually reincarnates.

- Like 7 of the 17 deaths he ""experiences"" are him being infected by the same virus and vomiting blood to death. It's so repetitive and a waste of an opportunity.

- The entire plot of him dying and being reborn, being ""Mickey 17"", is completely abandoned halfway through the film. It then becomes just ""leave these alien worms alone"". Barely halfway through the story the fact that he's a clone of a clone no longer affects the plot. It's just a second movie smashed into the previous one.

- Mickey 17 (main one) is intentionally portrayed as pathetic and spineless as possible, with Pattinson even doing an androgynous/child voice. It's evident what they went for but with all due respect the character is just not magnetic or interesting even in the ""beat up and mistreated underdog"" kind of way. The character is designed excessively shy and awkward, they could have told the same tale without going so far.

- His relationship with other characters is surface-level through the entire film, including Nasha. We never get to see any actual personal bonds between characters, specially not deep ones. Nasha never shows at any point any actual reaction to seeing two different Mickey clones at the same time, other than ""I'm gonna fuck them both at once"" (yes, while being high, but even when sober we never see any proper interaction about it)

- Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette's villains are extreme caricatures of white supremacy and capitalism.... that don't work at all. Ruffalo personally selects the crew for his mission, dozens of people of color that he personally picked and approved, but all of the sudden he's a nazi that wants ""a pure and white"" society and wants to make women just have babies all the time. Like.... he personally picked tons of people of all colors to go on the mission and colonize that new planet. The writer contradicted himself in a gigantic way simply to have a character to point his finger at.

- In a world where they can literally make humans from garbage, which is how they rebuild Mickey, Ruffalo's team wants to turn women into breeders and do nothing but pump out kids. Huh? Again, the writer is building one world in his head and then completely going the opposite direction just to complain at his own building. They can make all those babies with machines, why the hell would they go for natalism?

The entire satire for the story is similarly flawed, like Collette's obsession with sauces; going to extreme lengths of absurd dialogue and exaggerated performances to portray the villains as absolutely nonsensical, cartoonishly evil and pathetic on all levels as possible, only to have characters that make no actual social commentary and are simply fantasies of the writer to humiliate, beat up and blow to pieces (literally), while the audience only finds them insufferable and pointless.

In fact, the writer did not even do satire about any person or collective; the writer only satirized a made-up image he has in his head about those people. Ruffalo's character is much of Trump with some of Musk and some other political condiments, and as a person that hates those guys with all my might (seriously, they're some of the worst things that have happened to politics in recent history) I still have to say this was absolutely idiotic from the writer. He's not mocking any person or idea or movement, he's mocking an idea about them that he has elaborated inside his head.

- The alienation between the humans and the alien worms exclusively happens because of appearance. The worms are intelligent and give conversations thanks to Pattinson going OOOOHH AAARRRG BBBZZZRRRRPPP PPFFFRRR like Dory speaking ""whale"" in Finding Nemo, the worms are only misunderstood people inside worm bodies. The writer completely misinterpretes why alienation/discrimination appears: nobody in history went ""I hate the look of these people, attack them"" instead of ""their behavior makes them inferior"". The writer just makes up how alienation of peoples occurs.

- Steven Yeun's subplot is unrelated to the subjects of the story and ends up being pointless and not affecting the plot. You can easily remove the subplot and the character and have the same story. Also, the mob hitman sent to kill Yeun and Pattinson does nothing in the FOUR YEARS they spend on the ship and then suddenly decides to act, for no apparent reason.

- The film relies on narration HARD. Seriously way too hard. Almost half, maybe indeed half, of all plot information we are shown over the film is shown through off-screen voice narration. Past half the film it became way too much ""tell"" instead of ""show"", specially when you can easily envision quite a few sequences being presented with no narration and no dialogue. I am serious, if you look for it you can find plenty of scenes that could present the current storytelling of the sequence without a spoken word.

In fact, the story just relies on narration for a lot of the plot points, to such degree that it feels like many lines were added at the last moment, like ""just put Pattinson speaking over this"". For example, Mickey never shows any changes in personality or behavior even after dying and being cloned and dying and being cloned many times, BUT all of a sudden when Mickey 18 appears it turns out that there are indeed gigantic changes in personality and character with each new incarnation; not just small variations, but entire-personality replacements, like he just becomes a completely different person who happens to have the same name. Mickey 17 suddenly just addresses this by going ""Nasha told me Mickey 12 was so lovely, and Mickey 13 was an asshole, and Mickey 14 was too whiny...."" This is only treated as an afterthought, like something the writer never considered but suddenly wanted to mention, even though we never see it.",TheWeightPoet,26

Yes they show the hand/radiation and a handful of virus deaths but there's still a number of deaths they could have done - especially on a deep space ship where's there's tons of ways to die, just ask Isaac Clarke! It's most of what you're selling the movie on.

You'd also think they first death would've been more impactful since he says he's still scared of dying still - they show the gun fakeout with the character that seems important but then says goodbye to the movie save one more scene.

It was like Benny Hill in Space. I even heard an (unironic?!) Wilhelm Scream.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"A little torn on this one, especially what we’re meant to take away from the ending. There’s a lot of criticism in the film about the exploitation and expenditures of the working class, and how prevalent it is. 

It’s not a subtle film by any means, but some of its subtleties I really appreciated was how the ruling class keeps workers divided by annoying them and creating rifts and frustrations among them. So instead of unionizing and organizing, they’re more preoccupied with bickering and trying to do their jobs. 

The ending is what my partner and I couldn’t decide on. What are we meant to take away from Mickey 18 killing Kenneth? Did we solve capitalism by cutting the head off the snake and eliminating the possibility of Expendables? Because all things considered, it seems to be framed as a happy ending. 

Overall, it was highly enjoyable, and Pattinson was just a riot in this. Thoroughly enjoyed the warmth of Naomi Ackie’s Nasha too, I feel that she’s super overlooked in a film packed with great performances!",CMAProductions,23

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"Quite underwhelming. The movie was structurally messy with a lot of tangents and events that felt like they just happened to pad out the running time. Some of the characters were kinda obnoxious (Yeah, I get that’s the point of who they’re mocking in real life but it got tedious in the long run and I’m unsure how I feel about the performances here) and it seemed like in places the movie tried to be funny, but it fell mostly flat. Even storywise it rehashes some of Bong’s previous films and themes. The special effects and production values were great and there’s snippets of good stuff here and there, but overall a mixed bag and easily one of Bong’s weakest films for me personally. 5.5-6/10",AdrenalinDragon,87
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"Ugh my least favorite Bong by quite a margin

The first 30-40 minutes are rough, feels like there is no pacing with the constant narration and non stop flashbacks

I actually loved the second act with the Two Pattinsons and Ackle also was having a blast

Third act then seemed like it was written by Adam McKay, a lot of obvious political commentary, a weird climax, Ruffalo being insufferable in the end (I liked some of his scenes but there was just too much of him at the end)

For a comedy it was painfully unfunny most of the time

Felt like lesser versions of Okja and Snowpiercer blended together.

Bong is an Apex Mountain director for me, I must say I am shocked I disliked it as much as I did, and for something that felt 100% pure Bong in his themes",DangerousMatter4404,228
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"Anyone else think Ruffalo was actually kinda bad in this? I get he was playing a goofball Trump-esque character but I thought most of the choices he made were just cringe rather than funny.  
  
It probably doesn't help that I've been over these sledgehammer-subtle Trump stand-in characters for years, it's so boring and played out.  
  
Overall I thought it was an interesting and well made film, though the marketing made me think it was going to be about dozens of Mickeys hanging out, when that's not the case at all. The alien plot felt a bit derivative of Okja. Also thought it went on WAY too long and the first half was just waaaay more interesting than the second.  
  
Pattinson was really good, as was Collette.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"I enjoyed the hell out of this movie and it was hilarious. It almost reminded me of HBO’s Avenue 5 in some ways with the dark humor, but existential questions.

What I loved most about this film was all off the metaphors scattered throughout. Mickey 17 and 18 resemble how we change based on trauma, experiences and life moments; yet we still stay the same somewhat and have the same past memories and personality to boot.  Also, how Mickey’s friend Timo represents the selfish, pick-me persona that is so prevalent in today’s society. The “what have you done for me lately, you’re expendable” mentality. You can just ditch someone in a heartbeat whether it’s a friendship, relationship, professional situation. 

All the individual performances were fantastic. Robert Pattison knocked it out of the park. Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette together were hilarious and I loved the dynamic. It was very politically driven and made a statement on that behalf. 

I was also obsessed with the creature design in this. Basically a hairy roly-poly/sandworm prototype. They were adorable.

Too much of the humor was literally just swearing. It reminded me of Don't Look Up in the way it felt as though the writers thought they had the golden touch and didn't even have to try

Same with the political themes. Ruffalo was beyond caricature and got old with time. The same with his wife and the forced quirky sauce repetition. It was weird in a cringe way. White supremacists vs diverse crowds plus bugs is anachronistic in the 2020s. The world is a vastly more complex place and its punching at ghosts

Too much of the dialogue was written as quips that didn't land rather than as authentic character voice. All of the sex portrayal was pornified hypersexuality

I enjoyed Parasite a lot more even though was tired of the heavy handed politicking by the end

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],13/03/2025,My biggest issue with this movie besides the endless exposition of the first hour was introducing the creepers so early. It would have been more Bong Joon Ho esque to do it during that one chaotic scene,Watchadoinfoo,11
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"Absolutely discombobulated ass of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be and ends up being nothing.

I walked into the film knowing it was about clones, worker exploitation and capitalism and I expected a dark comedy in the style of parasite about expendable workers being exploited when the point is reached in a society where human life has no value. Libertarian Dystopia essentially, in the style so many videogames nowadays cover where workers are less valuable than the clothes they wear. (deep rock galactic, lethal company, hardspace shipbreaker, etc)

What I got was a shitty action movie where the cloning is completely inconsequential and could be replaced by literally anything without changing the events.

Seriously, the cloning is literally irrelevant to the events of the film. No philosophical questions are raised about the meaning of self, no points are made about expendability, and for a movie about clones the movie doesn't even have the balls to actually have the main character killed and replaced, because god forbid we bother raising the question of ""is it the same person?""

They even kill his clone at the end so we don't have to deal with any actual moral question of who is mickey. Even fucking oblivion which was a dumb tom cruise vehicle summer blockbuster action flick had the balls to at least do that. 

There are multiple points in the film where the movie straight up forgets its own premise, like when the scientists poison mickey after tricking him to a dinner with trump to test a new growth hormone, whereas previously they had no problem straight up ordering him to his face to get gassed so they could run tests, so why the fk was it nessesary to employ subterfuge all of a sudden?

So we could have the oh-so-hillarious comedy scene of trump trying to blow his brains off and ivanka complaining about his brains staining the persian carpet while he's writhing in pain? Master of comedy let me tell you. 

It flips between drama and slapstick comedy with the grace of a bull in a china shop. wtf was up with the gravy stuff? Is this a monty python film or something???

Everyone in the film is a complete psychopath to the point where I didn't really care if they got eaten by the tardigrades in the end.

Mark Ruffalo also completely butchers his performance as trump, which is awful because I'm pretty sure he has more screentime than mickey so you have to suffer him for like half the film.

Norm Mcdonald said it some years ago what the secret to doing actually good impressions is. “You have to like the character - and if you have contempt for the person you are portraying, it doesn’t work, because people don't have contempt for themselves, so your impression will fail right out the gate.""

Ruffalo's portrayal as trump feels like he was embarassed to do the accent in the same way inexperienced voice actors are too embarassed to shout. He would halfass the accent, the inflexions and the mannerisms. So everytime he was on screen it felt like I was watching someone fail to impersonate trump instead of actually watching trump. Which wouldn't be a problem if half the film's screentime wasn't dedicated to him.

I don't know who the fk this film is aimed at. Whether you're a science fiction fan or a sociopolitical satire fan, this film offers about as much to you as armageddon. It fails as science fiction and it fails as satire.

I have genuine trouble believing this is from the same director that made parasite, it feels like a cheap knockoff.",Prior_Memory_2136,57

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],12/03/2025,"Timely and somehow predicted the Trump assassination attempt. I even liked Ruffalo's Trump impressions. It's not subtle at all, but I don't care at this point.

But this movie tackles too many ideas at once. It jumbles around between one story idea to another. There is a classical Bong Joon-ho mid-point switch like Parasite, but it's not as smooth. Too much talking, and not enough acting.

Mickeys are rather passive with a little agency (which is kind of the point), rather, it often comes across as the other characters are driving the plot forward. One crucial ""action"" is when Mickey 18  decides to kill Truffalo, but it's so unmotivated and comes out of nowhere. It's not like 18 was the one done dirtied. And then there are pacing-halting breaks like a loan shark subplot, drug, and Tai, and these go nowhere.

There are two good movies stuck in one. One is about Mickey getting cloned, exploring the ethics of this tech, and being under the heavy pursuit due to the multiple situation, eventually gaining a class consciousness. The other is about a loose remake of Nausicaa where the question is ""what if in Alien, the humans are the bad guys!""

I find the first half compelling more, but it should have committed on either one of the two because the way the film is structured now, the audience is left wondering ""when does the movie really start?"" and... it doesn't, only pivoting to the climax of another movie that has little to do with the first half.",onex7805,8

Love Bong Joon-ho, loved Parasite, but this one was merely okay. The premise is great, but the film just felt like a big, sprawling mess. I didn't hate it or anything, I just found it disappointing.

One thing that bothered me: Why was the personality of Mickey 18 so vastly different from Mickey 1-17? He was extremely aggressive and acted like a completely different person.

For the first time in years, I was anticipating the release of a movie.  I thought that the movie was gonna be about multiple clones that want to start a revolution against the system or a thriller where you don't know who is who, kinda like the scene before the end. Some scenes felt too short and some scenes felt too long, especially the final battle scene. Also I feel that the conflict between 17 and 18 was resolved a bit too quickly and 18's personality change seemed so fast and weird to me which gave me the idea that 17 was trapped in the cave longer and that 18 was actually copy number 27 or something. In general, it saddens me cause this is such a cool concept and I can think of sooo many things that you can do with the cloning concept and we didn't get to see enough of them. Btw I don't know if it was my cinema, but some of the sound effects were also extremely loud.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"I enjoyed the film, but it kinda felt like 2 different films and one was abandoned midway through for another. We got the class hierarchy and ethical aspect from Mickey and cloning and they looked like they'd explore the possibility of the two Mickeys coexisting and maybe even in separate relationships. Then it kinda just got thrown to the side for a Starship Troopers like movie. The movie probably would've been better off if it focused on one message. I personally would've preferred the entire movie stayed focused on the expendables aspect and the moral quandry of the good to mankind they bring vs. the trauma it inflicts on one person, since there are already plenty of movies about space racism with humans going to a new planet and oppressing the native species.",Reishun,7
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"I've not read the book and just critiquing purely from a film standpoint.  First, the whole human printing thing was much more interesting than the whole alien plot that just seemingly took over the film at the end.  Almost made the whole printing/expendables issue an afterthought.  

Other than Pattison and Yeun, everyone was just too much... It was over the top quirky and over dramatic.  Even an actor like the caliber of Ruffalo, he played way too much into being quirky.  It seemed like everyone else seemed to be yelling every other line other than Pattison. 

The writing was also, cheesy or just plain bad.  I don't know if it's just lost in translation from Bon Joon-Hoo's writing, but dialogue was bad.  I'm pretty sure it's the translation because his korean filmography are great.  Also, so much unnecessary swearing lol.

After all these years I think it’s the lowest form of humor imaginable. Maybe 3 films that go with this schtick have ever had anything even remotely interesting to say. They teased interesting ideas with the religion and corporation angle but it ended up just being a meaningless dig at christians and capitalists. They could’ve taken it in a much more interesting direction especially with the duplicate angle if you ask me.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],10/03/2025,"Really wished I liked it more!


Lot of excess that detracted. The whole “other girl” plotline was set up so much so that I thought she was the actual romantic interest. So when she just disappeared I was confused as to why she existed at all. Felt the whole “sharing Mickey bit” was sorta lame for those characters. 


Same with Toni Collette. Did we really need her and the priest? It made her feel unimportant. Her sauce bit was weak. Same with the Steven Yeun bit. He’s an awesome actor, but did we need it? Do I need a really on the nose trump?


Also the ways in which the plot moves being unpredictable felt very much in Bong’s narrative style, but it just does not translate here. It just feels like a bunch of jumbled ideas and threads that somehow gets us to the end, but not in a fun or exiting way. Outside of Mickey, things just sorta happen and people just sorta do stuff.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"I was really dissapointed and while I can see why some people would like it, it kind of baffles me that there aren't more negative reviews. 

Mark Ruffalo's character wasn't particularly entertaining and really missed the mark. He's clearly a Trump stand in but he doesn't really do anything with the character. Like a lot of the film, there was clearly meant to be an absurdist/comedic element but instead the character was somehow both pretty bland and very annoying while not doing anything memorable. The workers, clear stand-ins for Trump supporters, are slavishly devoted to him but we're never shown even a hint as to why that would be. 

The comedy throughout felt really random and not particularly funny. Even the montage of deaths at the beginning, a clear opportunity to go dark and absurdist, felt very, I don't know, PG-13. 

The aliens as clear stand-ins for Native Americans was also just so on-the-nose as to make me roll my eyes. Of course they are perfect and peaceful in every way and it's the terrible humans, or at least the white people, who just want to destroy them for no real reason. 

I didn't understand the religious group/cult in the film. One minute it seems like Ruffalo's character is a supreme leader, the next its the religious group holding tribunals and handing down sentences. Those two things aren't necessarily contradictory but besides saying ""christians bad"" I really didn't understand the purpose of this aspect of the movie. 

I loved the other Bong Joon Ho movies I've seen but this one felt like it was just bashing me over the head with overt political/social commentary.",Pemulis_DMZ,59
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"I just finished watching this and hated it. I'm gonna add a disclaimer that I am not aware of the source material and I love science fiction so I was looking forward to this. Here's why I hated it:
- there was no nuance to the Trump/Musk impression... it just sounded like a straight impersonation + the red hats were way too on the nose. I would have wanted nuance
- the sauce subplot... huh?
- the way they just created a translator in no time for this species from a new planet... 
- (im bad at names but...) the character who seemed like she was in a relationship with the girl who died at the start only for her to go after Mickey and then for that subplot to just disintegrate...they could have moved the story along in another way
- the subplot of Mickeys ""best friend"" could have be tightened up
- it was just wayyyy too long a film. It should have either been a mini-series or edited way down 
- it felt like the narration tone wanted a Scott Pilgrim style, but the editing didn't match that pacing
- the narration in general spoon fed the audience and adds to the general feeling of the story not trusting its audience to get things
- I thought the acting was good for the main people but some of the smaller roles felt cartoonish when the film didn't strike that tone (see above note re: Scott Pilgrim)",BeatSneezer,14

It is insulting how this film just completely disregarded its audiences intelligence. 

I have no idea what the intention of this movie was either. It was meandering and tedious to the point of being painful. Was it a romance? A comedy? A commentary on capitalism? It literally had no soul. Just makes me angry thinking back on it.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"I may never get tired of the many ways Bong Joon Ho has to say, “fuck capitalism in its stupid ass.” and while I totally understand a lot of the criticisms of this movie, I had a pretty damn good time with it. It’s definitely got some form issues and feels much sloppier than Bong’s similar movies, but I left the theater smiling and feeling something. There’s a lot going on here, but the ultimate concept is watching Mickey regain his personhood and prove his humanity after accidentally signing his soul over to capitalism, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t get weirdly emotional when the ticker gave him back his last name in the final shot. 


The issues are apparent. There is way too much narration in the first act, so much so that fifteen minutes into the movie I’m kind of begging it to just show me a scene between two characters. Felt like I didn’t get a good idea of Naomi’s character until halfway through the movie because all we know about her is through the lens of Pattinson’s narration. And generally it just felt like it would introduce these ideas and not bring them to fruition, the sauces and the dream sequence at the end, etc. All that said, though, sometime in the second act when the narration fades out and this becomes almost a Star Trek storyline with the indigenous creatures I really locked into this. 

As I said, the main theme that is really well done is Mickey gaining back his personhood. You can definitely see the other parallels; the red hatted fans of a politician, the treatment of both expendables and the creatures as less than human, and maybe Bong’s favorite idea that calories/protein basically becomes currency in the future. But underneath all that really on the nose stuff is a much more interesting question of what makes us human. Is it our ability to sympathize with others, is it having a working mind and body, or is it the fear of death? Is it our memories? Bong ruminates on these ideas by juxtaposing those with “no soul” with a businessman turned politician who dehumanizes everything he can.

Gotta say, I love where Mark Ruffalo is at right now. Between this and Poor Things he is just going for it, having a lot of fun. If you have a keen cinematic eye you may see some parallels to Trump in this performance, but Ruffalo is so serious and passionate about these things IRL I do think it’s really funny that he is like, “yeah get me a wig and some veneers, I’m about to take this guy down with the power of my silly guy era.” Pattinson is great in this too, doing a great freaky little weirdo voice but also playing a version of himself that is totally different from the “main character” version. Everyone is good in this, really, but the writing is too messy to give them real meat although the dark humor shines through. Kai, especially, is a character that just kind of exits this movie at some point.

In a better year maybe this is a solid 7, but so far I have been pretty unimpressed with most the movies to release this year. I can see that this movie has a lot of issues and I wouldn’t blame others for focusing on them, but this got to me and had me rolling. The scene where Mickey gets invited to special dinner was so insane and chaotic I was dying watching Pattinson puke and scream while Ruffalo just goes for it. 8/10 for me. I just love Bong’s sense of humor and the way he aims it.",LiteraryBoner,88

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"Frustrating in how much it retreads common themes. *Avatar* famously did the “we are the aliens!” environmentalism angle 16 years ago, and did it better with how shallowly Bong hits that aspect. Even feels like Bong is recycling his own work - has echoes of Okja’s animal rights and Snowpiercer’s capitalism critiques.

This feels like the film version of Democrats wearing pink for the State of the Union. Lots of Trump critiques that simply don’t go hard enough - you can tell this was filmed in 2022 because it portrays Trump as a veiled fascist but still someone who can be reasoned with. 2025’s political reality is crazier than the Marshall character, so he feels like a kind portrayal rather than an over-the-top caricature. 

Left off encouraging the viewer to change our failing institutions rather than give up on them. But in Mickey 17, those institutions still have some fairness; its country rejects Marshall, the people elect fair councillors, and Marshall’s employees stand up against him. Mickey 17 fails in how hopeful it is about resistance. There is no institutional resistance to Trump left. The public can’t collectively organize for shit and has 0 power. 

Mickey 17 will alienate the people who most need to digest its messages, and it goes too soft for the people who already agree with its beliefs. It ends up being a boring, center-left relic of the early 2020s. At least it has Steven Yeun

As someone who watches too many movies I guess I kept expecting a few payoffs at the end:



Like the Mr. Blank guy is actually the serial killer inventor of the Expendables tech. 



Also the reason why Mickey 18 was so different. I get the throwaway line that they were all a little different, but 18 was both really full of rage (justifiably so that when you think about it it's actually a very rational response) and much more well put together as a person than 17. He seemed much more able to see the world around him, processed his grief about his mother, was generally a more heroic and decisive person.

  
It might be easy to see his sacrifice as the ""broken"" twin sacrificing himself for the ""whole"" twin to carry on: the excessive rage, the outward scarring. But really I think it's more the ""big brother"" sacrificing himself for the younger sibling because they still need a chance to live. Obviously 18 is the younger but he's much more adult and serious while 17 is almost childlike at times and what he lacks in resolve (and maybe intelligence) he make up for in empathy and love.

One character's big scene is screaming at Ruffalo's character about losing an election. Yay, it's like my relatives at Thanksgiving, except I paid $20 for a ticket and $14 for a beer to watch it.

Ruffalo looked uncomfortable, and Pattinson was terrible. Dude, how is one version going to have a weak Brooklyn accent and the next sound like Batman?

i do think that in terms of what was actually intended, the display of mickey printings being mishandled was more on commentary of how we treat expendables in real life. and i think nasha wanting all parts of mickey was more to show that she was the only one who didn't treat him like some gimmick and saw him as a person, all one person. but sometimes it's fun to just have your own little ideas :)",klondsbie,5

Mickey’s mother’s death was supposedly a key motivation for his character but the movie only brought it up like twice fairly randomly and there was no real redemption arc or anything.

Mark Rufallo’s performance felt like a bad SNL impression of Trump, but the character wasn’t really all that Trump-like (he listened to his wife, for one), and it felt jarring and ham-fisted.

The gags about him losing two elections in a row didn’t work as they were clearly intended to, for obvious reasons.

They never fleshed out what his church/cult/company was about, or who the committee were. I kind of assumed they were his puppets because he seemed to control them.

But then at the end they were suddenly an all-powerful group who could depose the leader and his wife and force them to attend hearings? It felt too convenient.

Oh, and he wanted to set up some kind of whites-only colony on the planet while bringing along quite an ethnically diverse team on the spaceship, including some non-white people in pretty senior positions. It just didn’t feel very coherent at all.

Overall, quite a mess that felt overly long while also not being able to find room for all its concepts and characters.

It was good to see Tim Key in a Hollywood role, though.",McCretin,5

I'm fine with sci Fi critiquing political or philosophical issues. They could have done that regarding colonialism, or even really honed in on what makes someone human. However, they turned the whole movie into an anti trump film--and weren't subtle. I don't even think the book itself was anti trump. Ruffulos shitty trump impression, to the red caps, to the ""pure"" race (something trump hasn't even expressed?? But they're obviously projecting) motif wasn't subtle, and frankly off-putting. The culture outside of reddit has shifted. Real people aren't as anti trump as Hollywood or reddit. They think they're making an bold political statement, when in reality, it doesn't resonate with normies. Instead, a fun subject matter with the potential for legitimate depth was glossed over to give the middle finger to MAGA. And he won anyway 😅

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"Mickey 17’s premise sounds good on paper. It should be a fun space romp, something that would fit Edgar Wright’s or even James Gunn’s style. But for some unfathomable reason, the film isn’t fun at all. It’s pretty slow, often tedious, never funny, and rarely (if ever) visually inventive. The third act drags and the finale is a drab slosh of grayish tones and CG muck. The plot has many underdeveloped elements which either have poor setup, poor payoff, or poor everything. It would be bad even on its own, but seeing as this is a skilled director’s follow- up to an Oscar hit, Mickey 17 is a shocking train wreck. There are two Bong Joon-hos. One makes serious, classy films like Mother, Memories of Murder or Parasite. The other is into pulpy genre films The Host, Snowpiercer and Okja. Mickey 17 was definitely made by the latter, but firing on no cylinders whatsoever.

The voiceover turned me off right away (as voiceover tends to do) and none of the humor works for me. I found myself thinking “oh that’s clever” a few times but never actually laughed at anything besides possibly the printer going back and forth, as real printers do.

The number of plot points that are abandoned in the interest of focusing on what feels like full on over the top political satire is disappointing too. Somehow there’s two Mickey’s and yet he still becomes a side character in the bigger natives vs aliens storyline.

Ruffalo and Collette would have been great if their roles were minimal and background. Sadly, their roles were not that at all. And they become too much.

I was on board with the giant exposition dump from Mickey in the first half of the movie, but in the second half when the *Multiples* situation arises after they've been spotted is where the movie becomes a bit disjointed moments in a Megalopolis sort of way where I was more so just baffled by decisions and how we got to certain parts.

I LOVED Mark Ruffalo hamming it up ... in Poor Things. This? Not at all. He has moments when he's not just channeling Trump that it works and it's sinister, but I don't know. Maybe in a different 2025 where Trump went to prison and we all laughed about how stupid we all were for 2016-2020 this on-the-nose parody of Trumpism would seem funny ... but it was too much, >!even if seeing him get blown to bits was nice.!<

I wasn't really a fan of Nasha at all. Kai felt pretty shallow as a character and the performance was a bit too wooden.

I did enjoy it though even though I fear I will forget large portions of it. I find myself comparing it to Poor Things with obviously both being comedic toned adaptions of sci-fi books where Ruffalo is an antagonist. Vastly inferior in that respect.

It pours in a ton of exposition early, to the point where the 'development' of characters is simply what Pattinson tells us through narration, and then grinds to grueling pace without ever exploring the interesting themes the trailer sells us on. I didn't read the book, but I imagine this is one of those situations where they try to hit as much as they can from the book to be true to the source material, but without ever going beyond the surface. I hope Hollywood learns that it's okay when a two hour movie misses major points from a 500 page book! Movies are movies and books are books and that's okay! Give us a good movie and we won't care what you 'missed' from the book!

Also the dialogue was really clunky and bad at times--chalking this up to BJH writing a full length movie in his second language for American audiences, can't imagine how difficult that must be, but the flaws are evident here.

And all the supporting characters other than maybe Steven Yeun’s were so underdeveloped. Like, what was Kai’s deal? Why was she here? I don’t know, the movie never tells us. And other than being a STRONG woman who loves Mickey, Nasha has zero characterization.

Just got out of a Thursday night showing (yay!). A ***lot*** more cerebral in the first half than I was expecting... possibly to its detriment. (This is yet another film where 75% of the cool shit is sadly shown of in the trailer... which also lies about what this is. Cool, Warner.) Still, it's a film by Bong Joon-ho in all its weird, delusional glory. Starts off slow and sometimes get lost in the weeds, but everything from the second half on is just balls to the wall *fun.* It's the year's first great blockbuster... warts and all.

Pattinson was great, both as the naive Mickey 17 and his far-closer-to-usual 18. Ms. Ackie was a goddamn ***revelation,*** holy shit. Ruffalo and Collette make for the perfect puppet-puppeteer pair. Production design and VFX are top notch, music's great and - while they are few - what actions scenes it *has* are expertly choreographed. And while Bong really has one theme (lol capitalism sucks), it really does never quite go out of style. Certainly not as the markets are tanking right now.

Robert CARRIED this film. His acting was spectacular as always, I just wish the plot knew what it wanted to be. I was hoping the film would focus more on Mickey, the entire dying/cloning premise, and all its implications. 

It felt as though the plot derailed right around the moment 18 goes to kill Mark Ruffalo. Suddenly the focus shifts to Mark Ruffalo, the rolypoly aliens, the debt to the old money lender gangster guy, and the female lead. A lot of focus was taken OFF Mickey - who I found to be the most interesting part of the film. 

Suddenly it became just another typical Avatar trope plot. 
Ahhhh evil CEO man wants to destroy nature/goodness for personal gain aaaahh, insert political figure you don't like here. But don't worry, the heroes overthrow them and somehow everything just falls into place perfectly, happy ending!! New government established!! 

For such an engaging and fresh first act, I was disappointed with how cliche and predictable the rest of the movie became.

Tried to do way too much, tonally all over the place, and I for one am definitely over the Trump-like portrayals of awfully-behaved leaders who gather a large base of support, behave like pigs, and end up getting their comeuppance in the end. I'm as lefty as they come, but this type of character/plot arc is long past 'trope' status. Mickey 17 added nothing new to it. Additionally, Ruffalo's portrayal was one-note and way too over the top. I was also disappointed in the plot trope of 'militaristic leader wants to exterminate friendly native species for no good reason"". I guess I expected more subtlety on both parts.

This character and these plot arcs overwhelmed the interesting premise of Mickey and his expendable status, which to me was not only not used for any larger or interesting purpose/plot, but also played for a tonally weird mixture of laughs (getting hand cut off by rotor blade) and sympathy/pathos (dying in an isolation chamber while being held by Nasha).",ryry9379,5
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],12/03/2025,"This is probably going to be a pretty unpopular opinion but I went to see Mickey 17 yesterday with a friend and we walked out of it like 2/3 through.

I rarely and I mean RARELY walk out on movies but midway through it I found it incredibly bad. Shockingly bad given that I LOVED Parasite. The entire time I was thinking ""is this going to get remotely good at any point"" and eventually My friend turned to me and said 'this is really shit, right? can we leave?' and I kind of agreed and we split.

Given the critical reviews and the user rating on IMDB I am shocked at just how unwatchable I found it. 

The story is pretty boring. Robert Pattinson's ridiculous accent he chose to use is distracting, he just is not good in this role, a few moments where his character shows anger it's just a little trying to hard. Ruffalo and Toni Collette going so ridiculously over the top with their characters was just distracting. This was not the Mark Ruffalo being ridiculous but entertaining like in Poor Things, this was the baaaad overacting Ruffalo. There is minimal score which makes several of the very slow, drawn out scenes where not much happens seem incredibly sluggish. There wasn't really a single likable character in the whole thing. I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, something interesting, something funny, or some cool set piece of action moment. I just sat there thinking how in the hell did this same filmmaker write and make something as brilliant as Parasite and then follow it up with *this*?

I think they should have shown a montage or something of the different Mickey’s and their different quirks set to 17’s narration to inform you that they can be different instead of just having Mickey tell you that after we’re introduced to 18.

What drags it down a bit is that it's a bit scattered and unfocused.  There's a long opening that gives a bunch of backstory that mostly isn't necessary.  Stephen Yuen has a bunch of sideplots that never add up to anything and another character, Kai, shows up for 10 minutes and is basically gone for the rest of the movie.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],13/03/2025,"Just watched the film, I enjoyed it. Liked the first half better when they explored the idea of what its like to be a expendable to the point where everyone pretty much over look them and easy it is to assume that the expendable died and create another. 

With that thought in mind, I was expecting that they were going have a whole bunch of Mickey clones wondering around as they then had to explore the whole 'multiples' issues. 

While the latter half was alright, it pretty much covered familiar grounds in a similar vein as Nausicaä.  

Anyone else was disappointed that the whole scene that Marshall and Ylfa used the cloning device to resurrect themselves despite their campaign against expendables was just a dream? Perhaps I'm over thinking it, but it would had explained Marshall's health issues throughout the film.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],15/03/2025,"Mark Ruffalo (Kenneth Marshall) is Donald Trump leaving earth with his pathetic supporters who wear red Maga hats. I think this was written with Trump as a broken man after his loss against Biden in mind.

Interesting? Except Trump is already such an awful charicature of himself, a blatant corrupt man. So much so that seeing a grotesque parody of someone already grotesque filled me not with laughter, but rathet with dread. What is the message in the film? What are we exposing here? Nothing too deep...

Mickey is a guy who has no choice but to join the project because it's his last option of survival  There is no place for him on the ship other than the worst possible role. He gets zero respect in Ruffalo's new society. Just like minorities in Trump's America. 👀👀👀

Mickey had this weird accent where I couldn't understand a third of what he said. The ruler lady was overly obsessed with sauce, which was clearly an attempt at social commentary but felt really clumsy. The trump character was funny in spurts I guess.

It was okay up to Mickey 18. Then the alien plot took over and lost me. I can't think of much that I actually enjoyed. The acting was fine? Overall just a messy, meandering movie.",guanzo91,3
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],17/03/2025,"Loved the exploration of what constitutes a double and if doubles can have different personalities.

I really like the book series of Red Dwarf (also a TV show that is IMO inferior to the books because it swaps the deeper themes for comedy), and one of the things I loved in those books is how they explore how different Rimmer is from his alternate selves. He exists as a hologram, and turns on another copy hologram at one point, only to end up hating him because he's changed in the period between his personality being copied and the time he turns on the duplicate. Then, later, a major sub-plot of a later book hinges on the fact that an alternate ""him"" appears from a parallel universe where the major difference is that one of them got held back a year in school as a child, and becomes an entirely different person as a consequence.

Seeing Mickey have genuinely distinct personalities and voices and attitudes was a really cool revelation, which I hadn't been expecting but which got me thinking.

I'd love to find more films (and books and TV) that explore that concept, as it's by far the most interesting bit of Mickey17 for me. But overall loved it for both that and also for the fun acting and characterisation!

Mickey 17 (and ones before him) seemed too nice, naive and docile. He was a willing participant of the complete destruction of humanity onboard the ship.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],14/03/2025,"Mickey 17 Thoughts 

Favourite scenes
- Mickey 18 attempted assassination scene, felt like a triumphant moment, almost celebratory of a luigi esque figure. I’m surprised a movie as big as this would almost overtly supportive of assassinating these political figures (as much as I’m onboard with it)
- Lots of great comedic moments - my favourite being during the threesome where Mickey 18 twirls Mickey 17’s hair, and when Marshall’s wife was more concerned with her Persian rug than someone’s brains being blown out in front of her  
- The shot at the start of the humans swirling down, ready to sign their life away was striking - humans circling into the drain, desperate, without hope 

Messaging
- Entertainment has become the mode of communication, the lens through which we see absolutely everything. Through the pursuit of an ever greater spectacle, all sense of morality or meaning is lost in both the lead performers and the spectator. You’re no longer a fully present person connected to the people and the world around you, you’re just numbed, impatient to see what will happen next 
- Humans can’t be trusted with technological advancement, it corrupts us and takes us away from what it means to be human - Mickey is the embodiment of this, the presence of the human printing technology strips him of his status as a fully fledged human being in the eyes of others. Once the machine is destroyed, he regains his name, identity, and self respect. 
- Mickey 17 was so meek, unable to advocate for himself at all, and 18 was the polar opposite? I struggled to understand the complete switch up in their personalities, and why 17 was so willing to accept his treatment. Is this suggesting that we are all susceptible to falling into the trap? And that we are all capable of bravery and standing up to it? 

Downsides
- Sometimes felt like a doctor who episode, that didn’t quite have the same sense of stature as a Parasite or Snowpiercer - it came off sometimes as goofy parody
- Mickey 17’s twitchy awkward demeanour was an interesting choice, he was a little off putting at times - I’m not sure what the intention of that style was. 
- It might fall flat because it presents to us the hell hole we currently find ourselves in, but the resolution feels unattainable. Where is our elite agent that will take one of the leaders by the neck? Where is our Mickey 18 who will sacrifice himself for the greater good? Are we supposed to believe following this, we can be elected as committee chair and everything will be rosy? At a time where we are grasping for hope, it all felt a little too neat.",jdar99,4

Less is more in this case, you already have a ton of things all going on at once. The only real saving grace is when 18 tells Mickey he wasn't responsible for the car crash and that it was a defect in the car.

Felt like a lot of the plot devices and characters were left unfinished as the plot shifted focus from the multiples to the creepers. Idk maybe I’m not astute enough to recognize some hidden brilliance there, but the multiples/3D printing aspect of the plot was the most interesting part of the movie for me and I wish they explored that more rather than shifting to the creepers.

The performances were good though. Mark Ruffalo was hilarious even though his character became quite tiresome as the movie progressed. And of course Pattinson was the best part of this movie.",JBBJ84,2

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"I found the first half of the movie to be much more interesting, since it’s more of a philosophical and character driven story. Mickey 18 is the first one to really be resentful of his status—maybe not surprising after 17’s “death” was him being left behind by his “friend” who started the issues in the first place.

I actually really liked the relationship between Mickey and Nasha. It’s sort of that old sitcom trope of loser husband and competent wife, but done straight. You get the sense that both of them are heavily invested in the relationship and they both really stick it out for each other. I would have been fine if 17 got together with the new girl and 18 stayed with Nasha, but then they really bring it home that Nasha has been there for every Mickey—for every facet of his personality, good and bad. 

That said, I have an urge to catch up with Chainsaw Man, because Mickey reminded me of a live action Denji at several points.",Time-Space-Anomaly,2

It was ok. Not bad but not great. Had the anti-capitalist message I was expecting but for some reason I thought there was going to be more humor in it based on the commercials and that we'd see more of the other Mickeys and their deaths. I also thought the Donald Trump stuff was a bit heavy handed to the point the villain seemed more like a caricature instead of an actual villain with actual motivations.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"Curious if this is a plot hole or if I misunderstood something. Throughout the movie Mickey seems to remember dying over and over. However at the start of the movie they also say he needs to wear that helmet to download his memories weekly so there are no gaps in memory. I would think that means he could never remember dying since that memory would die with him. 

Similarly he seems to be comforted by knowing he will be reprinted. This may be a case of him truly believing it or another plot hole unless there is another option I am not aware of.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"A theory I have for while Mickey 18 was a little more brash, violent, and confident in the concept of a soul. 
They mention at the start of the movie how one soul is allocated per person. And then there was the Dr guy who clowns himself. One of them was out living his life while two of them were murdering homeless people. It said one of them was used for an alibi. They never say which one was murdering people but my theory is his original body was the one living his life getting the “alibi” while the multiples murdered people. It also possible he created the two doubles to take the fall while he went on murdering the homeless. 

My theory is multiples are more violent because they don’t have a soul like the original does. When Mickey died and was printed out his soul would return to his body but when 18 was printed out he had no soul. While he ultimately was a good-ish dude he was quick to use violence and murder people.",Salty_Shark26,2
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"**TLDR: Today I watched Mickey 17 and felt like the script was partially, if not heavily, written by AI. Nobody else seems to be talking about this, so I was wondering what y'all's options are.**


Okay, I did a pretty deep dive in the comments here and I haven't seen anyone sharing the (to me, obvious) opinion on the writing of the film that I came out of the theater with. About halfway through I started to feel like the writing was similar to an *AI response to a prompt* that it was given. The more I thought about it through the rest of the movie, the more it fit. 

The meandering scenes and odd pacing, the constant dialogue from characters (out loud) explaining the scene they're in or actions they're about to take, the wildly varying emotional tone of the film varying by scene, the overall logic of the film, seemingly reacting to some of what's been previously established while having no clear idea of where the plot is headed, the *entire* dream sequence at the end that weirdly interrupts the ending... it all just felt like they fed a prompt, scene by scene into an AI to have it do most of the heavy lifting on writing the movie. The more I thought about this while watching, the more it made sense. 

To be fair, I liked the movie otherwise.
I liked the acting, the look and feel, the setting it takes place in, the fun scifi concept of expendables and multiples. It could do without some scenes (the screeching creatures actually made me cover my ears, awful), and some scenes could be toned down (Colette and Ruffalo's acting was extremely overdone), but I feel like there was an amazing film lost in this one somewhere. The script felt lackluster and lost in the possible directions the story could take place. As if each scene the script wanted to elaborate in its own way. As if the script was led by AI logic that doesn't fully comprehend full story structure.

I don't know if I'm the only one that feels this way, but I had to leave a comment to see. Let me know what you think and if any of y'all agree or think this is a possibility. 


BTW here's an article I found about the film where Bong brings up AI. 
Here's a excerpt from the article: 
""He feels the same about AI, which has loomed with increasing urgency over Hollywood in the years since “Parasite.” While some see it as a threat to human creativity, Bong regards it just as another source of material.""
And here's a link to the article:
https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2025-03-05/bong-joon-ho-mickey-17-parasite-interview-sci-fi
[Not sure how much this truly says, but seeing at the interview was about the movies and the topic of AI was brought up somewhat out of nowhere, I feel like this *might* (emphasis on might) be a sign that the script had AI assistance.]

So that nobody gets confused on my intentions on bringing this up (this is Reddit after all) here are a few clarifications on my post:
I'm not saying this out of ill will towards any of the team working on the film as a whole, including the cast and director. I'm not saying for a fact that the film is written by AI, it's just the opinion I reached while watching it. I have nothing against using AI as Inspiration, but if it was written mostly by AI, then I feel like that's mostly what made it such a disjointed film.

Let me know what y'all think. 😸👍",Consistent_Block4490,2

I was definitely expecting something different than a satirical rom-com in space (right? Was that what this movie was?)

There were some serious issues with tone throughout the movie, to the point where it was difficult to track the motivations of the characters, which in turn made it impossible to understand their actions.

i think the movie has a bit of a confusing storyline; i disliked what they did with kai's character (she was just confusing), i didn't leave with any strong impressions or philosophical thoughts, i didn't like how they randomly dropped that dream sequence near the end, i didn't love the addition of the drugs (although i understand that it is entirely relevant in the broad scope of capitalistic america), and their random use of the term ""prime"" that they only mentioned once in relation to that murderous scientist who created multiples of himself (forgot his name lol) while not using it during conversation with the ""prime"" creeper.

i think the movie did a lot of great things though;  i LOVED kenneth marshall and i thought that was a hilarious performance/twist compared to the book's version of marshall, they made plenty of good subtle jokes about the alt-right, robert pattinson did an incredibly entertaining job acting as mickey, i loved the way they designed and characterized creepers (i had envisioned them entirely differently but i preferred the movie design), and i adored how they highlighted the importance of nasha to mickey and how inseparable they are (her character was badass and i love her).

on one hand, i understand why they chose to add the detail that each printed mickey had a variance in personality, but i do think that by doing that they omitted a lot of the philosophical elements that the book focused in on; a major point of contention for mickey7 in the book was that he was constantly flip-flopping the idea of his own humanity, and whether mickey1 was him or some entirely different guy, whether it was HIM waking up every time he got printed, or if all of the deceased mickeys were permanently gone. the movie made it pretty clear that mickey17 and mickey18 were different characters, sharing the same memories, with different motivations and views on the situation they were in (in the book mickey7 and mickey8 were mostly the same). the movie kept it a bit simpler for the sake of time, but i almost wish they would've kept it more like the book.

also, one final thought, i wish the movie had put more of an emphasis on space travel, mickeys general knowledge/work in every department, and his love of history. mickey7 was very knowledgable and loved thinking about his circumstances in relation to historical facts; like comparing the downfall of a colony that didn't make it due to underestimating the sentient natives of the planet they landed on, to his colony practically treating creepers the same way and what that meant for the future of their colony. mickey7 was not JUST a labrat for the science department, he was a on-call repairman, agricultural tech, perimeter defenseman, and more. in the movie, we spent way too much time near the cyclers and science department, in my opinion anyways.

all in all, i will definitely be rewatching this, it was so fun to watch!",Vivid_Guest3279,2

I really liked the movie regardless! A lot of people were saying it's anti-Christian or whatever. As a former Christian, I'd say it's not anti-Christian as it accurately portrays the false leaders of Cultural Christianity which swampy politicians try to use to justify  their shitty actions. SO ACCURATE lol 

Obvs, Marshall was supposed to be a Trump-like figure but it was fitting to have a fake evangelical failure of a politician trying to live out his fantasy as a god-king over his little cult 😂 

Rob is FUCKING AMAZING as was the actress who played Nasha, they had amazing chemistry 👏🏼😩 

The bug plot was kinda EH, the story in general kinda went all over the place? I don't know if in the book Mickey's running from loan sharks but it kinda seemed like a plot that literally got forgotten as well as Timo. Still really liked it!

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],13/03/2025,"This is the most batshit crazy movie I've seen in a while. By no means perfect, but I was never bored. My friend and I were losing it in the IMAX theater every 2 minutes. We need more big-budget movies that swing for the fences like this.

I loved all the performances in some way, though Ruffalo and Collette were definitely the weak links. Way too hammed up/campy in an already heightened movie. Ruffalo in particular came off like he was actively trying to give the worst performance of his lifetime, and I really couldn't tell what he was doing between those dentures and his bizarre voice and the faces he was making. His character coalesced into something a bit more intelligible by the end but it was just a _weird_ performance overall - a more demented, less coherent version of his Poor Things character. Obvious Trump parallels throughout. Collette was less exaggerated, but whatever she was doing just felt like a worse version of what she did on Knives Out. Didn't understand her character's sauce obsession whatsoever, and it never became funny. Felt like something lost in translation to English.

Pattinson and Ackie were fucking incredible even as their characters stopped making sense. The duality between Mickey 17 and 18 was well-played and reminded me heavily of Enemy (2013), but I didn't understand how 18's drastic change in personality arose. They didn't seem to suggest that he changed as a person all that much between iterations, though there was some handwavey narration that kind of alluded to it later. Same deal with Nasha's character - she's portrayed as his ride-or-die for the whole first half, and yet she suddenly becomes more interested in 18, and her first reaction when she meets the two is to ask for a threesome while high. Only for her character to loop back towards being a heroine at the end. All those inconsistencies gave me a lot of whiplash, but the movie was already so fucking nuts that I didn't mind any of the mess. I was just having fun.

Definitely loved the creepers. They reminded me of the Arrival aliens a bit, with the immense sound design and the themes of communication as a tool to avoid all-out war. (The bluish cinematography on the planet also aided in crafting a similar vibe.) The grand, extremely on-the-nose speech from Nasha about colonialism felt like the one time the movie was legibly saying something tangible amidst its kaleidoscope of ideas. I didn't expect the resolution to revolve around the aliens so heavily, but it was fun to watch, if a little exhausting.

Most of the epilogue should've been chopped off in the editing room, especially that weird dream sequence, which totally threw off the tone and pace. 

Overall, hard to pin down, but undeniably daring, and loads of fun to watch. Would definitely watch again while high.",TheTruckWashChannel,3

I also assumed that we were going the love rectangle / philosophizing about identity route, and I'm SO GLAD it didn't. I felt like the love and identity themes were very very clear (Nasha is the only one who loves ALL of Mickey, and people contain multitudes).

I got all that pretty early and was nervous that we would spend the whole movie on it and it would get boring.

also, how good is the world building?! half the time i kept wanting it to turn into a nature doc because i needed to know what was up with the creepers and the planet itself. there's just no way the humans will be capable of permanently settling without some form of terraforming. 

the creepers themselves are freaking fascinating. there's some sort of hive-mindery going on with the parent (?) leader holding significant influence over all the others; coupled with them being intelligent enough to pull off bluffs. it's criminal this isn't getting a 15 episode 50 minute nature documentary narrated by david attenborough",thesagenibba,3

But if you are looking for depth, it’s not there. So many themes like religion, politics, violence, and class are brought up and never really explored. Hell, even death isn’t satisfyingly explored imo. The audience is basically just asked to fill in the gaps themselves by projecting our own reality onto the setting and characters i.e. Trump. It doesn’t feel like a fleshed out sci-fi world, it’s really more cartoonish than anything. Which is why the comedy works.

The problem is that the world-building and character building that happened in the first part doesn't really make me care about the world. I get it, I understand it, but it doesn't really matter that much for how long the movie spent trying to sell it. Supporting characters were all pretty good though, although the pay-off for developing them came really late into the movie and all at once.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,"I just walked out of the theater about an hour ago.

My synopsis:

Have you read and did you enjoy the book? Yes? Then you probably won't enjoy the movie.

For everyone else: It's ~~a decent bit of sci-fi~~ ok. Had it been an original work, it likely would have landed better with me. The pacing was a little odd, but I can get around that. 

I do think Ruffalo's character was a bit too trashy politician. Sort of a Trump/pick any megachurch pastor homogenization that requires constant validation and no criticisms. It really threw me off each time he was on screen, especially with his wife that had a ""I'm bored and this is my new 'passion' and no one has the balls to tell her it sucks,"" type personality. I know it's a caricature of the Conservative party of the USA, and it was hard to watch. The giant pigeon suit was weird (not in the book). I don't like how they portrayed the Creepers, they could have been better utilized as a threat, but again, this was, ""Anything I don't understand is bad and must die,"" narrative that the entire movie had. 

  
Robert Pattinson really shows his ability to act, however. He plays the same character in two incredibly different ways, sort of showcasing how the brain can create differing personalities depending on the situation.

I had high hopes for this movie, especially after seeing the critical reviews, but I'm overall disappointed with it.",bmcasler,2

Really liking what I’ve seen of Naomi Ackie as well, between this and Blink Twice, ironically two movies I don’t *totally* love, but I think she’s got a great presence in both. Loved her dynamic with Pattinson in this.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"Everyone stated the obvious already I'm wondering if this was originally a show or what studio interference happened cuz what the fuck was that love square? 

Why was Kai just a nobody, then she gets humanized at the dinner, in her room, then dropped from the plot? Why did they make Naasha so suspicious with the way she immediately latched to Mickey and didn't show us the really strong scenes like the ones where she stayed with him while he was being tested? I honestly thought it would turn out with the almost-threesome that all along Naasha had a clone kink or something. The poison flashback feels like they had to go back and insert it cuz it was really out of whack.

Pattinson was amazing. The entire thing almost had this broadly anime like sensibility to its characterization which I found a heap of fun. Coolest thing was I could never predict what direction it would take. I’d think it was going to explore one storyline and then it 180’d to something else.

They somehow made the little aliens adorable but look very alien, and when they did the firing squad scene, both of us were genuinely in shock. Those little baby armadillo-anteater-centipede-bison-elephant-mole creatures were genuinely cute.

The characters were phenomenal, especially the contrast between 17 and 18; the commander and his wife really went from buffoons to genuinely despicable over the course of the movie. The set and costume design was done really well too, with good CGI that doesn't take you out of it.

It felt chaotic and a lot like what’s happening right now. It’s not a movie I think we’ll look back at in 30 years and say this was a masterpiece, but I do think in this moment in time - as we face an onslaught of chaos politically - the themes of this movie resonate well. From the fake religious moments, environmental and animal rights, fascism this felt appropriate. 

Not his best work, Steven yeun and the Kai character were left behind at times but I thought this was very good.",givemebeernow,1
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"Had an absolute blast with the movie. I do think that third act goes on a bit too long, and it's kinda a big shame because you can tell that's where 100 million of that 120 million dollar budget went towards!

Setting that aside, my only minor critique would be that final sequence in the film related to the ""dream"" Mickey experiences. It \*\*really\*\* felt like that was shot post-Election. A very too-on-the-nose, \*well, shit, I guess Trump won again\* ending to try and have it both ways on the metaphor of the fact that people will always want to return to fascistic leaders that will simplify their world at their own ability to gain power (over and over and over again). I guess it just felt especially out of place because dreams were never really addressed or even hinted at in terms of a plot device until we needed this final ""hammer the message home"" scene. Just weird. 

Anyways, Pattinson was so fun throughout, and I think that dinner scene is gonna stick with me for a while. Those screams of pain from Pattinson got my entire theater laughing.",ak3331,1
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,I think the film was at its best when it was about Robert Pattison’s Forrest Gump in space.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"Maybe it's because I figured there would be no reasonable way to follow up Parasite, especially with a film not in Bong's native language, plus the fact that it leans full tilt into being a pretty biting silly satire, but I really enjoyed myself. Weirdly a movie I have structural and story issues with but I was never explicitly bothered because I was having so much fun. Speaking of fun, watching Robert Pattinson in this is unbelievably fun and enticing, he is acting his ass off in circles and this may be my favourite Pattinson role since he's given so much fun material.

Thought as always Bong's metaphors and satires were less scalpel sharp and more sledgehammer to the head - but that's also his style and I appreciate movies that are rabidly anti-capitalist that don't mince their words or lose themselves in the metaphor. Overall I think it's one of Bong's best English language outings, somewhere around Okja in my rankings but definitely better than Snowpiercer but not quite Memories of Murder, Mother, The Host or Parasite levels, but still an exceptionally entertaining film with a good heart.",Future-Speaker-,1

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"Was definitely a bit uneven with some characters that probably could have been cut to streamline it (I'm not sure what the point of the bisexual woman was. First she was sympathetic, then she starts causing issues for the heroes before basically turning on them and then disappears from the movie until the epilogue where she's gotten with someone new.)

But it was pretty fun. And it was impressive how Pattison could play basically two characters and just his face and mannerisms were enough that you generally knew which Mickey you were looking at (though back to critique, I feel like the ""each has a different personality"" thing could have been set up before 18 properly showed up. If it was something we were supposed to see, it was pretty subtle. They all seemed to be pretty much like 17 before 18 arrives). Really, all the actors were great.

I was slightly disappointed that the painkiller injection never came up again. I was hoping that would come into play beyond just being a gag. It was a funny gag, but maybe it would have given him immunity to the nerve gas or something. I dunno.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"Bong joon ho is usually so great at directing these very quiet and tender moments just advanced by the general atmosphere of the scene.  This is why i found it a little disappointing how the narration would often take control of what was happening as opposed to letting the scene play out, (such as the ending right before it turns back to reality and the closing of the expendable program) .  For such a major event, it felt a little rushed.  

First 2 acts were really strong but act 3 loses steam 

Such a great ost.  Just very whimsical which isn't what I usually find in a lot of current movie scores.  Sounded almost exactly like parasite (same composer) in the scene where M18 was going to kill Marshall

Tilda swinton was in bong's other American movies and I feel she would have really fit this movie well.  Although Ruffalo and collete  still worked well",littlelordfROY,1
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"I really wanted to like this but it’s just too messy for me ti really embrace. A lot of times it felt like the movie just sort of lost interest in various science fiction concepts it was juggling, focusing on one over the others and haphazardly returning to them when it was convenient. 

I enjoyed Pattinson’s performances, though. Did anyone else just start hearing Steve Buscemi’s voice  after a few minutes? 

Speaking of performances, one of the reasons this falls so flat for me has to be Ruffalo’s take on Trump. As someone who believes from the bottom of his heart that we ought to mock him till the end of times, this has to be the worst Trump stand in I’ve seen in a mainstream movie. It’s just a barely passable SNL vocal impression with reheated bits of his Poor Things character. And yeah, I get that Trump himself is devolving into a caricature of the one he already was, but that doesn’t translate to an effective onscreen villain.",None,1

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"I’m glad I read a few of the breakdowns on here. I rarely walk out of movies feeling like I missed something but I won’t lie some of the parts of this movie went over my head. 

I like that the Mickey’s weren’t just the same guy remade over again but reflections of parts of his personality. I just wish we got to see that instead of hearing about it through the VO. I think having Pattinson do the VO is a big miss in this one tbh. It never felt right to me even though I don’t think it was bad per se. 

I also think Kai was kind of a miss for me too. I get that while she’s a nice person she’s still ultimately a part of the problem (by shooting the shit out of the baby and not recognizing that her girlfriend died because she shot an ice shelf directly above her head), but it would have been nice to see her reckon with that a bit. 

I thought the dream part at the end was kind clumsy too. I don’t think I got that all the way either beyond Mickey learning to stand up to his own mind I guess. 

Overall I liked it, it was fun and definitely funny. Pattinson can fucking act man, seeing the dichotomy of the two Mickey’s was really cool I wasn’t expecting that based on what I saw from the trailers.

I don't think it's Oscar worthy or even profound by any means, but it's just a fun character study with good satire thrown in. It's far too front loaded with exposition, but Pattison's performance makes up for a lot of it. I thought Ruffalo was fine here and he gave me more Matt Gaetz vibes moreso than Trump. There's one or two moments where the latter comes out, but that's unavoidable in this day and age if you're gonna have a character like that.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"I think that this film started out great. The first half of the movie was awesome and, so I believed, was setting up for a great climax and ending. However, the second half of the movie really disappointed me. I thought they would go for a more revolutionary approach. There are many ways they could have done it. I thought it would be more interesting if 18 succeeded in killing Kenneth (During his show). This could have created a larger dynamic between 18 and 17, which I thought would be focused more on, while also creating more light on how the people on base could react. It’s like the whole plot shifted after this scene and really only focused on the bugs. I think that most of the A-list actors were perfect, but the side characters provided little meaning imo. 

Overall, I would say this movie is watchable and is liked depending on how you like the focus on the second half. I personally think that the first half of the movie is 9/10 and the second half is 1/10. 5/10 overall for me.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],09/03/2025,"I loved the book and didn't expect this to be too much more than a popcorn sci-fi flick so for the most part, it hit the mark and I found it funny and entertaining. The acting is great all around - I love over-the-top satirical acting. That being said, I agree with many of the scathing reviews here and understand that Bong lovers would expect something a bit more cohesive.

This movie missed out on the chance to explore many of the existential questions that were more thoroughly explored in the book due to Mickey's role as someone who repeatedly dies and is ""brought back to life"" (or so he thought, until he accidentally survives and realizes that each iteration actually does die). This was such a great medium to ponder the whole idea of where consciousness arises from - is it a biological thing? If someone were to make an exact replica of you, down to the very last molecule, would your consciousness be the same? Also, does memory make us who we are or is there something more than that? If I suddenly replace all my memories with yours, will I suddenly start acting like you? Such cool things to think about that I barely got a glimpse of in the movie.

A couple more minor issues: The whole Kai subplot didn't add much and fizzled out. I think she was supposed to be a foil for Nasha - while Kai wants only parts of Mickey, Nasha loves every side of him, which is cute! But in a movie with very obvious ""sides"" her character was too gray and underexplored. Also Nasha's two yelling scenes didn't fit well - I had to keep reminding myself that her character was tripping from huffing oxy and it's supposed to be a catharsis of letting out our frustrations at the system. But the people she was yelling at were so calm in response, it felt a bit weird.

One theme I do appreciate Bong strengthening in comparison to the book is the idea that you are more than your job. Bong returns Mickey's humanity by the end of the film. ""I don't deserve this."" Everyone gathers to witness his era of dehumanization ending. That's a powerful ending, vastly more so than the book's anticlimactic, stalemate ending (yes I know there's a sequel, I read it and did not really like it. Bong's conclusion is better).",dunecello,1

I’m taking my friend to go see it on Friday, but unfortunately her dad passed away a few days ago, so we’re really going to get her out out of the house and take her mind off things. She’s a massive movie lover and we had talked about going to see Mickey17 before he passed. 

She asked me to do a bit of research and just check that the story line contains no dead dads/family members, or people living with dementia. I don’t really want any spoilers so I can’t really google it haha so just wondering if anyone has seen it can they advise whether it has any of scenes involving the above.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],12/03/2025,"Saw it yesterday and went in basically blind only knowing that it was Bong Joon-ho film with Robert Pattison and Steven Yeun. 

I think it was really solid. It's really hard to follow-up *Parasite*, which I consider one of my favorite films ever, so I definitely went in with more tempered expectations. I really liked Pattison's and Yeun's performances. I'm a big Ruffalo fan, but I think his character was a little too on-the-nose and was kind of over it by the end.

While this wasn't the smoothest storyline and not on the same tier as *Parasite* for me, I still overall had a fun experience. I'm kind of interested in the book now.",Cvspartan,1

One question I had tho- is why does everyone keep asking him what it feels like to die? He wouldn’t remember any of his deaths right because his memory backups would be taken before he’s in any death situations

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],17/03/2025,"I do think the movie had a lot going on. It's funny there's been a lot of TV series I felt could have just been movies but this is a movie I felt would have benefited more as a miniseries. I could see each episode being titled after each mickey. 17 honestly seems low for a four year flight mission, thought they would have been doing a lot more experiments. Like a higher number just shows how devalued he is to everyone. 

It veered into starship troopers in the end which I'm surprised many reviewers didn't mention. I didn't much care for that subplot. Like settle on a message. Anti capitalism, corporate religious cult, ethics of cloning, authoritarianism, immigration, colonialism, etc. pick something. 

I don't know when we got to giant space bugs it just made me long for more absurdist Verhoven style satire

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],19/03/2025,"I can appreciate a lot of the criticism in this thread but overall I liked this movie and it made me reflect on a lot of things. I think it helped that I didn't really see a trailer so I didn't have any assumptions of what the movie would be.

7/10 solid movie

**Likes**

* I loved the juxtaposition between Mickey 17 and 18, especially in the discussions around trauma. It was really interesting to consider how we might hold ourselves back even though somewhere inside we know better than to feel guilt. I know some viewers felt like the personality deviations weren't well explained but I took it at face value and found it to be really meaningful.
* I also loved the commentary on how workers can be seen as ""expendable"" and how socially someone might be treated in that position.
* The potato bug creatures were so grotesque and so sweet.
* I loved Nasha. She was so fiercely loyal to Mickey and always had his back. >!The scene where she sits with him while he's dying was beautiful. !<It was such a pure love. I also loved her chemistry between Mickey 17 and 18. It was fun to see how she just accepted Mickey, however he came.
* I'll watch Toni Collette in about anything and enjoy it. Her performance here was so absurd and so bizarre I loved it. The sauce thing was insane but I appreciated some of the comments here comparing it to the British colonizing for spices.
* I also loved seeing all the different players, especially the scientists. You could tell that at times they weren't approving of Kenneth and Yifa but they were willing to look the other way in order to protect themselves or to get access to the scientific opportunities they wanted. I liked seeing their culpability.
* There were some really funny moments.

**Dislikes**

* I was unhappy at the reveal that >!the creatures were bluffing. I thought it was really powerful to show this (superior) species had not caused any harm to humans even though they could take them out. It was a mirror to how the humans behaved when they thought the creatures were just non-sentient bugs. I think the idea that they were bluffing just took all that away, and it was also really unsafe for them to share that information. What's stopping the next generation of humans from trying to kill them? I just didn't see any point in that. !<
* Mark Ruffalo. I love him but I don't love him in this. The Trump impression was kind of grating (like f\*ck Trump but I don't want to sit through that for 2 hours) and it would have been more interesting to just see a unique, villainous character.
* Some plot threads did seem to fall apart or get lost.
* I appreciate the meaning of the dream sequence at the end but it felt really out of place (at first I thought he somehow had passed out and started dreaming, but I guess it was just a memory of a dream?)
* I'm sorry but the voice that Robert Pattinson did as Mickey 17 was so annoying and it took me out quite a bit.
* At times it felt like it dragged or was much longer than it actually was.",willyoumassagemykale,1

A lot of the storylines just felt so pointless though. Everything with that Kai girl didn't go anywhere and was just dropped unceremoniously halfway through. And the Church stuff feels like it's going to be important then just ends up adding nothing to the story. Could've just cut both those things from the script entirely tbh. 



But still enjoyable all in all. If a bit on the nose. The burns on Trump would've landed better if he had lost the election as it seems like they thought he was going to.",jamiebond,1

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],24/03/2025,"This movie is so unlike the books it makes my brain feel like it's melting. So many details are just changed for no reason and time that could be spent on actual lore and world building from the source material is just absolutely wasted making Mickey seem like he's mentally deficient when in the books he's described as a perfectly average human (by today's standards) living on a world populated by the unions brightest scientists, engineers and artists. But instead in the movie it's just earth, no one is special and marshall is basically just trump with a spaceship.


The biggest gripe I have with this movie is the fact that in the book Mickey is a history hobbyist, a gambler, a nature enthusiast, so many personality beats to go off of but in the film he's basically just a mental case saying random shit about macarons and the smell of jemmas hair. 

And the Jemma scene, first of all, completely rushed. And the entire point of giving Mickey the gun in the books is to have him do it himself. See if he's really comprehending the fact that he is gonna die many many times by making him think he's about to willingly end his first body's life cycle only to find out the gun was deliberately a dud. 

Why then does Jemma tell him to shoot himself, wait literally one second and didn't even explain why or how to do it in any meaningful way, then proceed to grab the gun and pretend to shoot him??? Makes absolutely no sense in context.


TLDR- the books are actually good and thought provoking meanwhile the movie is just cash grab garbage and such a disappointment.",Satric_,1

Unfortunately, the movie did not live up to my expectations. It had a few good moments and some laughs from the audience (not as much from myself), but too much of it was just a mess.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],29/03/2025,"Very late to the party, but here are my thoughts. The movie had a really cool premise. I especially liked how ""realistic"" it felt, the whole disinterest after the 4th or 5th replication of the well being of Mickey, or the exploitation of the workers in the system. 

However, the movie has a couple of big issues: First off, it introduces way too many themes, but doesn't really develop any of them. This is in part due to the really rushed story. It felt like the set up to the true story was half the movie, and the developments at the end with the revolution and uprising felt rushed and out of nowhere. The themes of rebirth, the value of life, the problem of having Multiples and to decide who is original and even colonialism, exploitation and class consciousness felt incredibly rushed and unsatisfying. This is apparent also the in the fairly weak performances of the characters. None of them felt like they had good character growth. Mickey 18 was the worst by far imo. His 180 felt really rushed, even though I understood where his sudden sacrificial nature came from. The character of Kai felt absolutley misused, so did Timo and basically anyone but Mickey 17 and Nasha, but Mickey 17 didn't really change that much tbh.

  
I don't know, the movie is fine, but I can't help but feel they tried to cram too much without really developing anything. The world building was very nice, though.",FakeDaVinci,1

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"This movie started out a little slow and heavy on the comedy side of things but about half way it picked up and get much more interesting. It touched on a lot of relevant topics in a new and light hearted way — bringing civilization to a new planet, cloning, dna editing, even fake meat. 

“We are the aliens!” was the best moment and a great way to sum up this movie — and I was very surprised I wasn’t too grossed out by the creepers, normally I’d get serious skin crawling heebie jeebies from mass gatherings of creatures like that (ants do that to me) but it must have been the humanizing of these creepers that made them ok to watch, very well done.  

The one part that stood out to me as a little odd was the end when they had Mikey blow up the human printer — they were all excited and acting as if this should be a happy moment for him.. and in a sense it was because it was marking that he was no longer expendable, but he was also giving up the option to keep living post death, giving up that feeling of not being scared to die because he can come back. Just felt like that should have been touched on a bit more.

Also Mark Ruffalo — just wow, after this and Poor Things, he’s really cementing himself as an excellent eccentric actor with some range, he was hilarious.

Bong Joon-ho continues to demonstrate his mastery in blending genres, but here, the satire and lack of subtlety in the narrative end up limiting the emotional and philosophical impact of a story centered on sociopolitical themes like identity, technology, and colonialism.

Nevertheless, with a star-studded cast led by an excellent Robert Pattinson and a captivating audiovisual style, the South Korean filmmaker reinforces his status as one of the most creative directors working today, delivering an experience that falls somewhere between fascinatingly hilarious and frustratingly superficial.

Many of the comments I see some people here kinda skip  over the point of marshall and what he represents in the movie. In Marshall is exactly what he looks like, a corrupt billionaire who is actively making life worse for everyone because he wants to play the role of a glorious leader. No matter how you dice it he is quite literally current Trump/Musk. A man who is openly two-faced and frankly evil but since people love him or think he's too much of a joke they let him exist in power. It takes literal footage of this man about to kill an objectively innocent thing for people to snap awake. And there's nothing exaggerated about that in real life.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],29/03/2025,"This is a bad movie gang. I generally found the jokes to be unfunny and the timing to be off. Why did the movie spend so much time focusing on Timo? He is really not relevant enough to the plot to justify this much time, especially after we've established how they ended up on this colony ship. 

I found 17 to be an unlikeable character for most of the movie. Maybe that was by design, but it makes him really annoying to watch. And this is personal, but I don't like the voice RP does for Mickey 17. 

To me, the worst thing was that they really don't use the theme of cloning to make any significant societal statements. I was expecting something more substantive about how capitalism or technology dilutes individuality and decreases the value we place on human life.

Obviously this is a movie of its time, a critique of current world events and people. It's pretty on the nose about that. So I don't think it's a stretch to assume the whole colonization part of this movie was referencing this. How cruel the antagonists were towards the baby creepers and condemning them to death because they're in the way made me think about how Palestine is mostly children. The most insidious part was the bald guy who was always subtly nudging Ruffalo's character, when he's talking about how he's going to frame the situation from a PR standpoint. Notice how the goofy and zaniness of Ruffalo completely disappears when he tells Nasha to bite the rope. That level of cruelty is the underlying factor that nobody dares bring up.",FiddyFo,0

- Robert Pattinson killed it as all of the Mickeys! His tone, speech pattern, speaking volume, and body language are different with Mickey 17 and 18. Honestly, he should be a lock for Golden Globe nomination at the very least.
- Mark Ruffalo had the time of his life playing a stupid dictator with a slightly expanded vocabulary. 
- The movie is long and there are some pacing problems. Although I appreciate the title card dropping almost 30mins into the movie, the flashbacks to Earth could have been condensed.
- Some subplots did not seem to go anywhere such as banning sex on the first day of the voyage because I thought it was lead some babies or a crazy reveal that the scientists experimented with the food to kill eggs/sperm. Kat wanting Mickey 17 then disappearing from the 3rd act was weird.

That said, I did feel like 18's drastic personality shift was at least in part because of a brief disruption of the memory/personality upload that occurred when one of the techs tripped over one of the wires. I think its possible that some part of the data was corrupted/lost leading to 18 being different. And I really felt that they would revisit that moment and make it explicit.

Food (specifically the control of it as a resource) is used to control a population.

Objectively the sauce is revolting. 

Sauce in cooking is used to mask or adjust the flavor to what it’s added too.

Like, her husband is taking over a whole planet under her guidance but there's not a bit of spice seemingly found on this ship. The food that she serves to her supposed precious guests? Not cooked by her. 

Sauce, however? That's something that can get complicated real fast if you make it yourself. So she's making this sophisticated thing to cover up how the ship food is like pretty much all slop. And it makes her look like she's doing something nice and domestic, like cooking (even though we all know she's not).

I mean you could probably use how 17 and 18's perspectives on him demonstrate how the differences in their personalities warp the lens of their memories.  Maybe because 18 is an impulsive hothead his view on his memories with Timo frame him more of a fuck up who could have gotten him gruesomely murdered.  But the Mom memory thing probably was enough.

Though really Timo's plotline just makes me question what the debt collector's agent is getting out of this.  Aside from video evidence of Timo carrying out the deed potentially taking years to get back to him, and he only bothered to contact Timo when they got to the planet, the agent is effectively giving up 4 years of his life just to kill two people?  How much is he getting paid for this?  How is he getting paid if fees for monetary transactions through space cost so much?  Is there a plan for him to go back to Earth and if so doesn't that mean he is giving up almost a decade or more for his boss, who may be dead by the time he gets back?",Viron_22,15
Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],07/03/2025,I think the reception for this movie will lean negative as people begin to rewatch it and realize that all of the characters in this movie are very bland and go through no arc or change of any kind by the time the movie ends.

In hindsight, I wonder if it can be interpreted this way. Nasha was the only one to not see Mickey as expendable. Kai showed kindness, but still bartered for him like he wasn't an actual person.

I understand why the scene was there, to show that 17 is still human and people can even treat him as such, but it felt rushed and out of place in the film emotionally.

And again, they could have removed the entire Nasha/Kai conflict for a tighter story. They could have just knocked Kai out and then dealt with things while she's locked in some locker or closet. Clichéd, but it would have been better than the minor conflict we got.",2th,158

They make a point that mickeys memories are stored in the brick so he doesn't desync too much from the next version - so his clone would only have the memories from up to that scan, not dying in the virus tank or getting ""eaten"" by a space bug.

Maybe I went in with the wrong expectations, but Parasite had such an enormous range, it felt like you could watch it drunk or high for the silly humor, or write a PhD thesis about its deeper themes.

The dream occurs bringing back both Toni and Mark’s characters because of the machine and Toni offers her hand where her blood pools up.  To me this dream he’s thinking about what keeping the machine will do.  Not just possible to bring them back, but also his life.  Part of him is scared to press the button as he is no longer “immortal” but also knows how dangerous the machine can be if it is still around.

I’m not religious or even necessarily that spiritual, but that line of questioning from the Senator, talking about cloning, talking about “souls,” intrigued me.  I thought about that scene, because I do tend to believe in the “human experience” and my mind has convinced me that there is some kind of innate human energy, whether or not “soul” is the right word for it.

And then to have the chance to explore it with Mickey 17/18 and only explore it through their independent actions?  No dialog, at all, about how they could be so different?  I thought maybe there would be something about how Mickey 18 didn’t have a “soul” because Mickey’s was already being used.

Mark Ruffalo completely butchers his performance as trump, which is awful because I'm pretty sure he has more screentime than mickey so you have to suffer him for like half the film.

Norm Mcdonald said it some years ago what the secret to doing actually good impressions is. “You have to like the character - and if you have contempt for the person you are portraying, it doesn’t work, because people don't have contempt for themselves, so your impression will fail right out the gate.""

Ruffalo's portrayal as trump feels like he was embarassed to do the accent in the same way inexperienced voice actors are too embarassed to shout. He would halfass the accent, the inflexions and the mannerisms. So everytime he was on screen it felt like I was watching someone fail to impersonate trump instead of actually watching trump.

As an audience member, Nasha came off as possessive of Mickey through the first half while Kai seemed like she just wanted Mickey to be his own person, and it was a frustrating and well-worn trope that Mickey would reject Kai and stay with the ""safe"" and familiar Nasha (at least for now).


Until that scene, when you can fully understand why Mickey is undyingly loyal to Nasha: she has viewed every version of him as worthy of love and care. She has never taken his life (lives) for granted.


It also recharacterized the argument between Kai and Nasha from earlier. Nasha wasn't just being possessive and staking her claim - she loved all parts of Mickey and wasn't willing to trade any of him away.

> 
> Why then can Mickey remember dying? Surely every death will always be after the last memory upload?

I got the same impression on how his memory back up worked.

It goes against having everyone asking him that question even though not everyone might know how his ""lives"" are supposed to work. It also goes against the fact we are shown, kinda from his POV, his many very short lives where he doesn't last a week if not even a day.

> And why was Mickey 18 so different? Surely his personality - and memories - would be identical to his predecessor’s?

Mickey did say that previous iterations did have different behaviours too. The stark contrast between the two is because they are shown a lot and next to each other.

As for why... Well, that's SF, it depends on the whims of the author. It can explainable many ways. One of those could be too much fecal matter in his printed version compared to another version with too much recycled wooden straws. Or the printing process too, we see at least three printing versions were the process didn't go quite as planned: one almost fell from the printing machine, another one did completely fell and one got one of the liquid tube disconnected for a few seconds. That's a 20 hours process and they seemed to be quite nonchalant about it. Who knows how fucked up his printings went each time, same for the memory upload.",Perpete,3

Mickey is the people and at the end he retains some of that fight, he still chooses peace but he remembers to fight when needed, if tyranny came back, he stop it. 18 recognizes that 17 blame himself for the actions of corporations that don't care about him (the car accident). 18 recognizes that they have been manipulated and abused by their so called friend, their whole life. 18 moves to tear down the system and gives his life to destroy an evil status quo. In a way, one could even see it as inevitability. You pressure the meek for long enough and you'll create the strong.

Not sure about the first question but I was thinking he wears gear that gives a ""live"" feed when he's at risk (Space suit, suit for exploring, head attachments when he's testing vaccines), but he also saves every once so often when he's not in active danger just in case? 17 does say that he needs to do regular uploads (Weekly, I think?) so his memories aren't too far behind. But then he clearly remembers losing his hand when he first dies because he flexes it to see that it's back when he gets printed again, and we're shown that they left his body tethered outside. 17's comms and other tech in his suit were destroyed by his fall so 18 shouldn't have any memories after falling no matter what.

2.) Is ocassionally mickey's bodyguard.

3.) Fetishes clones and is completely unempathetic to mickey when he needs it the most. 

4.) Has a slapfight with another woman over mickey's clone that is forgotten about and never brought up again.

The only person in the movie with this realization is 17, and even Nasha doesn't seem to care as long as she has a Mickey that is hers at the end of the day. I think it would have been brilliant for Kai to come to this realization at the dinner when she realizes at the dinner that the leader only sees her as a uterus to be used. Both Kai and Mickey (and basically everyone who isn't Mark Ruffalo+Wife) are only seen as bodies that can be used and expended, not as actual people who have inherent value.

Hey, I want to add to this by saying how I think the movie explains the personality changes. I haven't seen it mentioned in other posts, because it's a throwaway line/bit. But basically it was during the montage in which he's being copied over and over, and the scientists are shown as being incompetent and careless. I'm pretty sure Mickey 17 is the one that got one of the cables disconnected, when a scientist guy trips over it because he wants to check some coin tossing game. It'd make sense that when you get a faulty upload of personality/memories you'd have some personality changes.

Also later on he talks about how his girlfriend has told him that certain Mickeys having different personality traits, including one that was boring and 'slow' mentally. I think it can all probably be explained by the incompetence of the scientists during the printing.",NotDoingTheProgram,308

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],24/03/2025,"Fascinating, I had the opposite feeling. I loved how unique it was and for each of these points I find myself thinking how I actually like it.

* I like that we didn't have rich people going immortal (it's been done, for example in Altered Carbon) and bought the explanation that it was something only for psychopaths and the dredges of society.
* I liked how surprising it was that 18 was extremely different from 17 and very much liked the themes the movie explored in terms of seeing two different aspects of one's own personality. I liked that we weren't clued in that each clone was different, because it made discovering 18 all that more exciting.
* I liked that it _didn't_ have a colonialism-bad message; 17 was able to find harmony with the locals, and many of the humans join in with 17's efforts. Avatar has a hardcore anti-colonial message by contrast for example, showing almost all humans as being cruel by nature (except for those that have adopted the native ideology (or literally transformed into natives)). Whereas in this film, it's primarily the Trumpian leader whose lack of intelligence, vanity and cruelty is the problem, and once he is disposed of, the true nature of humans comes through.
* I loved the Trumpian leader and am confused by the idea that his death was an example of Deus Ex Machina. The Trumpian leader gets himself killed thanks to his own vanity and lack of intelligence/empathy. He shouldn't have gone outside, and he chose to do so, following the personality traits you've seen so far.",melted-cheeseman,2

Then all of that dissipates into the background and Nasha regains her place as the one who cares for the Mickeys.

Also Kai asking Mickey how it feels to die seems like another red flag against her but she does do it apologetically and because she is grieving.

Nasha was actually the prick. She gave no shit about M17 feeling at ease, she did drugs and gets too aggressively horny, and then the whole threesome was super creepy. Like.. If they were two same mickeys, sure, I can see the erotic potential. But we had already established earlier that M18 **isn't** actually like the original one. So even if their dick and their pimples were the same, if not any from M17 point of view it might have been as well *you* on that bed.

The techs are so incompetent and careless that it completely shattered immertion for me, the fact that the movie did the ""half printed clone hanging out the chamber"" gag multiple times completely took the cake and made it hard to take anything in the movie seriously.

Mickey was cloned 17 times in nearly 5 years, and the techs couldn't give 2 shits to ensure the presumably multimillion dollar clone they have to make like 3 times a year is printed properly because they are too busy playing on their phones?

Felt like it was constantly dragging on while never committing fully to any of its themes or ideas. 

I felt the climax was incredibly anticlimactic. The whole build just to have a conversation with the creature in a very unsubtle way after barely exploring the more interesting elements of the story, like having multiples. 

One of my favorites of all time is Sorry to Bother You, and one of my favorites last year was The Substance, so being ""unsubtle"" is something I quite enjoy, but that's only if you craft the film to lean into it so much creatively.

So it doesn't match the real world it's why it doesn't work and makes no sense to conservatives.

Of course it's a lot more obvious when you have people wear red hats and put in references like that so we get it but it still falls flat and doesn't make sense unless you've already bought into the left's world view and their caricatures. Basically, the left doesn't know or care what conservatives really believe, they make their own caricature of it among themselves that becomes their own reality, and that is what they base their parody on.

To have him upload base state by suicide during this thought locking it into his need to be expendable or punish himself. 18 says it wasn’t even the mom or something. Maybe he was abandoned and that’s his coping. The way they hush secretly rush commit him after signing seems there is a group interest in the unethical program to continue. Essentially we have an unreliable narrative and 18 might be truth. Perhaps the tube was pulled on purpose by a sympathetic. Not having the upload current also. Then you have his shit friend who could easily sell out Mickey to the job in exchange for pilot. I’m not sure we see or know other personalities as this one was very much different and remarked on. Maybe having some kind person as he died built up enough to care about himself in uploads dying during the virus. He was proud. Pressing a button makes no sense. To kill his mom. Not mom. 

Then there is final flashback or is it a memory?  Buffalo lives forever cannibalism and such. Why not back themselves up?  Why is the memory safe a brick?

Throughout he is chosen for ability to take trauma and be controlled. I think they did not realize he stuffed away parts of himself. 

He was already multiples.

This is perfectly captured during the dinner scene, wherein you've got 17 in an immense amount of pain.

Mickey 18 is proactive and takes matters into his own hands, although the only thing he can do in the end is sacrifice himself to kill the enemy. Although 18 is now dead, he doesn't leave Mickey Barnes, and offers strength in times of absolute fear and loss of control (aka nightmare). He is Mickey's coping mechanism and a reaction to being an ""expendible"". Toni's sauce making is not supposed to be a quirk or aesthetic, it's to show how unreasonable she is and how she values her own taste over others' lives.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],10/03/2025,"Strongly disagree. You might have heard the line about capitalism subsuming all critique of itself, but a related idea is that stories about victory over oppressive regimes can often redirect an audience’s anger away from real life oppressive regimes and make them feel like they’ve had a victory by empathizing with the fictitious characters.

The dream sequence is essential to Joon-ho’s message to the audience, because he’s telling the audience that these motherfuckers will keep coming back and coming back and you have to keep telling them to fuck off. It sets it apart from other resistance genre movies that serve more as release valve than call to action.",avicennia,16

Hell, all through the movie I kept thinking ""Obviously Marshall and his wife have uploaded their memories as well...maybe they'll come back for a sequel that way!""

Bong Joon-ho anticipated that train of thought and put a stop to it, by first dismissing the 'resurrection' of the villain as *literally* just a bad dream, and then blowing up the printing machine.

There is a reason I specified ""actually explores them"" dumb action films using random sci fi words the writer heard on tv don't count. Hivemind and cloning are literally inconsequential to oblivion in every single way imaginable. I shit you, I legitimately had no idea the aliens in oblivion were a hivemind because it matters that little to the plot. 

Same with ender game. Brilliant book, great film, but the film focuses more on the military and child soldier aspect than it does on the hivemind aspect. Its a military film first and foremost, and a sci film secondarily. Its like saying that starship troopers is a sci fi exploration of hiveminds. 

Its not. Its a military film that happens to feature a hivemind. 

Never let me go is just a remake of the island. Its more of a personal drama than a sci fi exploration. 

I will give you moon and Upstream colors though because replicas was kinda shit. 


See this is my problem. Hollywood writers like to use words like ""cloning and hiveminds"" but they don't actually exploring them in any meaningful capacity. 

>Those are stock sci-fi plots, and Mickey7 didn't really do anything new with them.

They may be stock plots but we have very very very few movies actually meaningfuly exploring them. They just use them as set dressing for other plots, case in point I'm honestly shocked you mentioned never let me go but not the island.

There's a scene where they say Mickey 18 had some growth hormone experiments added in, it's during the dinner scene. Obviously 17 hasn't had it, but that might explain why 18 acts so much different, they probably meant some form of human growth hormone possibly to make him more muscular over time, which from an acting point of view Pattinson probably interpreted as that version being all jacked up on testosterone and thus way more violent than 17 was. They also mention a few times that every Mickey has had differing personalities, because we only see 17 as the main narrator we don't actually know what his previous versions were *actually* like.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],16/03/2025,"Yep - very hard to watch for me. This appears to be the thread on this post that poses more of the questions I'm curious about. So pardon, I'm very long-winded.

I found it very complicated - both in its representation of trauma and political commentary. 

Like there were parallels between Marshall and Preston to Trump and Musk. Marshall and Yifa gave me Nancy and Ronald Reagan Vibes. 

As for the trauma, I think it's pretty clear that the various versions of Mickey are the multitudes that become very difficult to navigate or define when you experience trauma.

They made it seem near the end (when the Mickey's were out in the snow talking with the big bug thing) like there were multiple people vying for Trump's position.Yifa, taking advantage of Marshall's stupidity. Preston taking advantage of Marshall's ego. I was confused by the agent intervention. I don't know if that was necessarily supposed to fit in as a parallel to anything. Would be interested in hearing other perspectives. Especially since it's Nasha that winds up taking the helm on Niflheim (I feel I may have misinterpreted that). 

I bring up Nasha because she is portrayed as such a very caring and loving person. But also the scene where Mickey 17 catches up with Mickey 18 and Nasha for the first time in his room - It makes Nasha out to be an objectifier of Mickey as well. It's weird, it seems almost like anti-drug messaging by using Oxy to question Nasha's character in this scene. And the emphasis on the role that sex has in their relationship seems very objectifying of Mickey - or maybe more fairly that their relationship seems relatively one-dimensional. Would also love to hear people's perspectives on this.

At any rate, I think the way that they portray Mickey's relationships definitely speaks to the way I experience trauma. I love the people I have chosen to keep in my life very much, but the doubt that you have constantly of whether you can trust someone is mind breaking. You're supposed to rely on other human beings to survive and thrive. But also they are the source of your greatest anxieties - unintentional triggers of your worst memories. Often the reality seems to be that people are complicated and to judge them wholesale often is an injustice to those we love and compromises our grasp on humanity.

Trump inherited hundreds of millions from his father and still managed to bankrupt multiple businesses. As for working every day, he spends most of time golfing, ranting on social media, and making incoherent speeches filled with factual errors and bizarre stuff.

- If attempting to stop the peaceful transfer of power by force isn’t an insurrection, then what is? Trump spent weeks fueling the “Stop the steal” nonsense, riling up his supporters with baseless claims of fraud, and then directed them to march to the Capitol. Even if there wasn’t a fully orchestrated coup plan, the intent was clear: to disrupt democracy. Trump refused to call off his supporters for hours while they engaged in violence.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],17/03/2025,"I just saw this yesterday, and while I’m also curious about the smell stuff, I think the differences in personality of 18 can be explained away with 17’s voiceover when he mentions that Nasha told him that various Mickeys were a bit different from each other, some weak, some brave, some funny, etc. 

I think we’re meant to infer from this that each Mickey is as different from each other as 17 and 18 were. One of the subtexts in the ending is that 18 wasn’t just a different “flavor” of Mickey, he was his own unique individual. Nasha’s first rant to Kia displays as much, as she vehemently makes the case that these aren’t just slices of Mickey that you can strip off and keep as you like. Through the differences that we see between 17 and 18, we learn that each clone has agency and individuality - they each make different decisions, even when faced with identical inputs. Given all this, “assigning” a girlfriend to them would be wrong, since that action would assume that “copies” of a person lack the individual rights that the “original” would have been entitled to. 

**TLDR** - 17 and 18 are *supposed* to be pretty different to show that each “copy” is an individual person, not a disposable resource. ",Free_For__Me,23

There's a few shared themes and the setting is roughly the same ish but the film isn't a particularly faithful adaptation of the book. If you're interested in exploring how it feels to be an expendable, and explore whether it truly makes you immortal or not it's well worth a read. 

The book is a much more grounded story with much more realistic characters and slightly harder sci fi elements.

The film is telling a different story. The film to me is a story about how cults of personality and capitalism can abuse people and nature without valuing things like morality or human lives. 

The book is more focused on things like the ethics and philosophy of being an expendable (disposable in the film). The ship of thesus gets brought up a lot. There's a small scene where 17 and 18 discuss whether they really live on or not but the book goes deeper into that philosophical point.

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],12/03/2025,"Just came out of movie. Normally I defend movies changing things to work better on screen, but I think most changes ended up for the worse here. A lot of the mentioned aspects here in the book are there to emphasize and dive into Mickey's self esteem and identity. Having hyper competent friends isn't boring like you might expect because the book isn't really throwing Mickey into action scenes or situations where the hyper competence of his friends trivial them. As far as stuff with aliens goes, it's worth noting that in book the aliens are far more alien. They don't really care humans killed their ""babies"". They purposefully kill humans basically to dissect and understand them, but they don't view it as an act of aggression. They are a hive mind and to them tearing apart one or two randos is just how you feel out your new neighbors and get to know them. The book's conclusion works because Mickey has come to (vaguely, as shown in sequel) understand the aliens but knows Marshall doesn't. If Marshall had Mickey's interest in space history, his earnest attempts at understanding the creepers, or his general lack of a superiority complex, he wouldn't have fallen for the ploy.

Not saying movie needed to be exactly this though. Basically cut the religious stuff that went nowhere since there's not time for the book's context, cut the loan shark plot and Timo because it didn't really add anything (they just didn't really have time to dive into Mickey's relationship with him, so why is he here?), and keep the aliens being well alien.

How in the hell can you be such a purist zealot, dehumanize even a fucking person just because they have come out of a printer and not a vagina, want to sterminate the entire race of filthy aliens... But then you are also some kind of open-minded exotic food aficionado?

Either the commander is a corrupted incompetent that we can assume was chosen from the higher spheres *exactly* for being a trusted zealous drone and nothing more, or the colony is just this ""imperfect hijacked democracy"" that you have to fight for. But then you cannot make a Trumpssolini rule it for 4 years, or if not any you cannot keep such over the top harmful leader - and then make such ""by the book"" impeachment at the end, as if nobody else could know of impropriety before.

> The philosophy of the leaders is supposed to be inconsistent.

Power just for power's sake is pretty consistent mindset actually. But idk why you bring this up? Of course the movie wasn't supposed to be about the way of the government.

> This film is meant to be farcical, which usually includes pretty blatant messaging on purpose. 

That I had understood. But then Nasha delivering that serious truth-to-power speech (if with some swear words) was cringe?

Mickey 17,Official Discussion - Mickey 17 [SPOILERS],08/03/2025,"My guy, this is Bong Joon Ho's style and has been his entire career, Memories of Murder is a horribly depressing drama about chasing a serial killer but the main detectives are idiots and the cops dropkick a new dude every fifteen minutes. I agree that this can lead to tonal whiplash and I do think he struggles more with that tonal balance in his English work vs his Korean work. Even then, it's still very much a trademark of his entire filmography.

This comparison to Sandler is completely off base though because it's never even trying to be anywhere near a Sandler film, it's got a lot of goofy stuff in it but a Sandler film would never swing for more than a fart joke, this is still absolutely trying to say something and a lot of folks found it to effectively say that. Like I've said the whole time, if that's not your thing that's totally okay but it's not like it's an abject failure in filmmaking simply because it's not your speed.

I also think you're misrepresenting Parasite a bit, I think it's Bong's masterpiece with a fantastic balance but that is also a movie dealing in very real socioeconomic issues in a mildly satirical and heightened way that also features a family of idiots and a lot of physical comedy and features some incredibly funny scenes.",Future-Speaker-,14

I don't think ""Its supposed to be shit."" is a very good excuse for something being shit. And besides, I don't even agree with your permise that its supposed to be shit. None of other bong's films botch the tone this bad.

Like dude, the jokes aren't even good. ""Clone tech that has to do this task once every 4 months fucks it up because he thinks angry birds is a higher priority so clone falls on the floor"" is litterally scraping the bottom of the barrel for slapstick, that's why I call it adam sandler esque. 

That is why I also actually recommended a fix that you dismissed as ""caring too much about sci fi"". If he had to clone 10 times a day then it would make sense for him to not care and point out how people get desensitived to horrible systems through sheer exposure. But that would be too subtle I guess right? Can't have the jokes actually tie IN to the metaphor of the film now do we. 

You can weave surreal lightheartedness into drama, Barry is a good example of a drama with surreal comedic undertones without undermining its main point or causing tonal whiplash.

Mickey 17 is just cramming entire adam sandler bits into the film at random and expecting it to work. You have a pg13 comedy mixed in with what is attempting to be parasite esque sociopolitical satire. 

A lot of folks effectively find adam sandler movies to effectively say things. Populism isn't really an argument for quality.

Is it going through the motions? Yeah sure, but at least it does so skilfully.

Mickey7-17 is not only not philosophical, but it doesn't even bother exploring the cloning angle at all. You don't even have to do ship of theseus. Something as simple as mickey being assigned escelatingly more and more and more imposibly dangerous tasks and dying over time as his employers get more and more reckless and place less and less value on his life as a metaphor for inflation and worsening working class conditions while he starts having the personal drama over it would have been good enough. 

The only time the movie ever even gets close to this is at the start where the pilot places more value on retrieving the flamethrower than his body because its more expensive but that angle is dropped almost instantly from the film and NEVER brought up again. Something like lethal company where extraction teams aren't penalized for having employes die, but ARE penalized abandoning their equipment on the planet because human life is worth less than the clothes they're wearing. 

In fact I suspect that WAS the case at one point. The movie shows us the mickey counter like twice in the film and subverts it at the end by removing the number and adding his name but it doesn't have any significance at all because we've barely seen it, in an earlier draft I suspect that was way more present in another version of the movie that was focused on the cloning.",Prior_Memory_2136,4

That wasn't even a question? M17 ***already*** states that he cannot recognize M18 as himself (it doesn't exactly seem big brain philosophy to argue that if your personality is \*completely\* different, then you aren't the same person). I couldn't either FWIW.

Why that was the case is never clarified, but variations into the printing process seems to be the first suspect (now that I think to it, even some whatever novel event having happened in those 2 hours of life seems unlikely.. because then M18 would have the awareness and ""situatedness"" to guide even his older peer through it).

Mickey 17,Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' Review Thread,07/03/2025,"Damn. I’m really upset about this. This was one of my most anticipated movies this year, but i was left pretty disappointed overall. it’s crazy cause this movie starts off INCREDIBLY strong in the first half but then quickly just crumbles into its own self indulged absurdity, with absolutely NO redemption on ANY of the themes that are introduced. So many cliches, themes that are empty and lead absolutely nowhere, it just seems like nothing was ever fully fleshed out. 

There was a lot to love about it though. Pattinson OBVIOUSLY brought his A game and was carrying the movie the entire time. The set design and cinematography were INCREDIBLE. It’s shot very well.  The way cloning was explained was really interesting and i was fully hooked. But in the end, everything just fell short. 

It’s so weird that it essentially boiled down to an Avatar-esq “humans bad, animals good” type deal which was such a bizarre choice given the entire first act really focused on so many other, MORE INTERESTING elements. It could’ve genuinely gone down so many different paths but it chose to explore the literal smallest plot point that was very briefly touched upon in the first act. Not to mention, plot points that Bong has already addressed in his previous films time and time again (in much better ways might i add). 

It started to become this VERY on-the-nose absurdist political sci fi comedy that just didn’t stick the landing due to its lack of context within its genre-mashing mess of “themes” that were all fighting to take the spotlight. I mean, the over-the-top performances by Rufallo and Colette were definitely great and funny (like the dinner scene) but then in the third act it started to become more of an obvious political reflection that wouldn’t stop dragging. It was like telling a joke that had the implication of something deeper and was actually smart and funny, but then dragging on that joke for another hour to the point where you’re literally explaining what the joke means. Like yeah, we got it… The whole movie wanted to be satirical so bad, but ended up kind of just coming off as empty and pretentious. It genuinely had no idea what it wanted to be. There were classic Bong Joon Ho elements of class distinction, political satire, animal activism, etc… but also newer themes like dealing with death/what death truly means, the psychology behind cloning, etc… but none of ANY OF THESE THEMES ARE EVER EXPLORED FULLY THROUGH. Leaving this entire movie to feel like a bunch of ideas that were just started but never completed. It felt very amateur, which i would’ve NEVER expected from Bong. 

Idk, i didn’t read the book so idk if that adds any context to anything. and i think it genuinely would’ve benefited MUCH more by being adapted as a 5-part miniseries rather than a 2 hour movie. This would give more depth to each individual theme and deeper character stories that would’ve made for a much cleaner story. 

(small rant with small spoilers in this paragraph only) >!WHY DIDNT THEY GO DEEPER INTO THE MOB BOSS THAT WAS OBSESSED WITH DEATH?! THAT WAS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING THAT ENDED UP HAPPENING. Also, the guy that originally cloned himself and committed a murder was SO COOL. THEY SHOUDLVE FOCUSED MORE ON THE CLONING ASPECT OF THIS MOVIE. WHY DID IT GO THE ROUTE IT DID?!!<

TLDR; Pattinson carried, looked beautiful (the movie itself and Pattinson), but fell completely flat in delivering its over indulged, messy politically charged plot that constantly struggled with proving to the audience what the fuck this movie is even about.

Mickey 17,Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' Review Thread,07/03/2025,"Bong Joon Ho being the director is both the best and worst thing that could have happened to this movie.

Mickey 17 is quirky and idiosyncratic if this is your first Bong Joon Ho film, but for those familiar with his filmography, you already know what he's going for and what you're going to get.

Mickey 17 takes the underlying subtext of his two films, Snowpiercer and Okja, and makes it overt. Snowpiercer critiques the social ladder in an economically segregated train fueled by the poor, whose labor is exploited by the rich. The same goes for Okja, a commentary on corporate greed involving a super pig. Mickey 17 combines both with an added layer of self-worth and identity among the underclass.

All of Bong Joon Ho's films share the common theme of people compromising themselves for their goals, specifically how the lower middle class is forced to corrupt itself to get ahead in the world. Mickey 17 is no different. Due to some issues on planet Earth, Mickey signs up to be an ""expandable"" on an intergalactic ship exploring a new planet called Nifelheim (As a fan of Norse mythology and the God of War, I was proud to recognize that reference). What’s an expandable? An expandable is someone who’s replaceable. If they die, their body is reprinted, their memories transferred, and they start anew as if nothing ever happened. Our story focuses on the 17th iteration of Mickey Barnes.

Watching this movie, one can’t help but wonder if this is a recap of the director’s previous works—almost like a replay of his greatest hits. Mickey 17 acts as an unapologetic political satire while also heightening the absurdity that has been a hallmark of his style. Whether it’s the ridiculous yet realistic action sequences, clueless and incompetent authority figures, or the tonal whiplash, the film amplifies what we’ve seen in his previous works.

Robert Pattinson gives an exceptional performance as both Mickey 17 and Mickey 18, displaying contrasting personalities and experiences with ease. He ensures that both Mickeys have their distinct souls, with neither feeling like a caricature of the other. Mark Ruffalo plays the corporate political villain, a character that hints at someone we all know. However, Ruffalo, in his affable and charming way, makes the character his own in a peculiar way. Toni Collette plays the batshit crazy woman with such conviction that it might make Tilda Swinton envious.

Mickey 17 falters due to the expectations—or rather, the conformity—set forth by Bong's previous works. It isn’t an edge-of-the-seat thriller like Parasite, nor are the social commentaries as incisive because the absurdity dial is turned up compared to his previous films.

You’ll only feel disappointed if you know who the director is and what his previous works are. But if you do, you'll understand why only Bong Joon Ho could make a movie like Mickey 17.",Exotic_Vampire,21

About the first 30 minutes is just exposition, then you get some more exposition sprinkled here and there throughout the 2nd act of the movie. I liked the 3rd act minus the last 10 minutes or so. That daydream (?) scene of Toni and the print machine seemed out of place. Not sure if it was supposed to make me feel something. It doesn't make you contemplate the meaning of that scene either since they just narrated what it meant after that scene was over.

Robert Pattinson is the stand out in this movie, and he does a lot of carrying IMO. He was great at playing two different versions of Mickey. It must have been exhausting acting in that voice pitch. Mickey 18 kind of gave off The Batman vibes at the end. The one actor who I thought was really weak in this movie was Mark Ruffalo. I felt like I was just watching Bruce Banner. The same Bruce Banner where he was cheering when Thor showed up to the fight in Wakanda in Avengers: Infinity War. His acting is very dry when it comes to comedy; the delivery doesn't stick. It was like watching a villain from those live action Disney movies, but maybe worse. Someone like Chris Hemsworth or Ryan Gosling would've been a better pick for this role that Ruffalo did.

The Parasite was brilliant because it mostly have not sided with anyone (other than that one scene where the family had to deal with the flood, which was later used to show how ""rich"" are out of touch), but this one...is clearly taking sides but the message doesn't give you anything to think about.

And I wish there had been a stronger emotional resolution around the treatment of the clones. Great, we blew up the clone machine.

Mickey 17,Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' Review Thread,10/03/2025,"Getting the good stuff out of the way first...
Pattinson's acting, in two wildly different roles, was solid (ignoring the odd accent in the narration), and the on-screen relationship between Mickey and Nasha was on point. Nasha's character was a consistent backbone for the ""they're both Mickey"" humanisation element of the printed expendables. It is interesting to see Ruffalo's interpretation of what Trump would be if he were blended with Goldblum's Grandmaster from Thor Ragnarok.
The intended satire themes - targeting extra-planetary colonisation, corruption, capitalism, marriage of religion / government / corporation - are a poignant mix for the current climate, in theory at least.

Unfortunately, it feels very much like the Mickey7 property was merely a vehicle for a screenwriter to inject their satirical comedy into, with the resulting combination failing to please on basically all counts.

Mickey7 and its sequel raised questions around human nature, the nature of the soul, identity / individuality, and lesser themes like the interaction between religion and science. The Mickey 17 movie contains the facade of all these things, yet when you scratch the surface, all you get is more surface.
Marshall's character is warped into Trumpian satire too far to offer more than a throwaway line or two about Mickey being nothing but sacrificial meat, with no focus on book-Marshall's religious views regarding the soul or the 'humans playing god' aspects of the cloning process. There's no attempt to give his views or actions any kind of legitimacy, leaving nothing for counterarguments to stand against... so they just don't exist in the film.

Mickey's variants all having different dominant personality traits (noted by the narration line about Nasha caring for all of them despite the differences between 3 and 5, as well as the fundamentally different characters we see in 17 and 18) really throws off the philosophical questions of individuality in the novel; the ship of Theseus paradox is raised several times in relation to questions of each Mickey having their own identity versus the idea of a single continuity of self, with plenty of time dedicated to pondering whether 7 and 8 are really the same person and whether they continue to be as both live simultaneously. The movie rips this apart by having 17 and 18 be so diametrically opposite right from the off.
This is twisted further when the movie keeps in Nasha's belief that they're both Mickey... despite the fact that, besides appearance, the movie offers no basis for that at all. They don't diverge as they gain different experiences, but begin as entirely different characters: a weasely misfit and psychotic maniac.

The only theme found intact in the adaptation is the xenophobic attitudes and militaristic problem-solving when it comes to the Creepers. Alas, this is one of the biggest tropes in sci-fi, and even if the movie gave it a solid go (which it doesn't) there wouldn't be any ground to cover that hasn't been done a hundred times over by other works.

Equally, the injected satirical-comedy story that sits behind the trim and frills of the original novel suffers from the blending of the two. Apart from the fact that it is about as subtle as the brick-drive prop gag the movie uses to store Mickey's mind, none of the analogues to current American politics or political figures are really helped by the veneer of cloning expendable people that is central to the property. The two ideas share some commonality and fitting them around each other with a little delicacy could be done to good effect. But the ham-fisted alterations to jam in clones of Trump, red-hat-wearing sycophants, and Musk's ""colonise Mars"" solution only serve to harm both the original story and the story they clearly wanted to tell.

Finally, a couple of personal peeves with the movie...
Marshall is presented as the pioneer of space colonisation, having failed on Earth, yet the dinner scene and the 'one true' chant both set the colony above other colonies' societies. Those colonies that, in the movie narrative, don't exist...?

Kai Katz differs hugely from the book's Cat Chen. Normalising a bisexual character is a nice thing to see, but Kai's only role seems to be token queer and counterpoint to Nasha's view of both Mickeys being 'real'. The ambition she has in the book, the emotions at Jennifer's death, the betrayal... all non-existent or minimalised to insignificance.

Narrator-Mickey not only runs through masses of exposition, but does so for things we're seeing on-screen and can work out for ourselves. He also switches between current internal thoughts to addressing the audience and back... is he the internal voice of the character or the omniscient narrator? Pick one.

The sudden shift between main plot points only adds to the weird chaos of the movie. The Creepers don't really matter for the entire time we're in the base and dealing with the multiples issue, then all that gets shunted aside to deal with alien kidnapping and hostage negotiation.

And lastly, the most fundamental themes of the book - regarding identity between the Mickey clones, the importance of the individual, and the contrast of the Creepers' auxiliary beings - are all just thrown out the window in favour of giving the cute rollerball puplings names.

Overall, the whole thing seems to have been dumbed down for the lowest-denominator audience. It's an adequate distraction with a few laughs if you have no knowledge of the source material and want to kill some time and mock the low-hanging fruit of current US politics. As an adaptation of Mickey7, it's a butchery.",Jeddicus91,2

It has some solid acting, good chemistry, an interesting concept, and good and competent production values.

Mickey's friend also disappears, I thought he would of played a better part in the end but his storyline is wrapped up in a montage.

Also at the end of the movie they terminated the expendable program, but why? They actually need that and that helped them alot with researching humans and finding cures. Why not just change what happens when there's a multiple? 

Instead of killing both people and there minds, when there's multiples, just don't?

Also Robert Pattinsons voice was a bit annoying for me, and the sound in the theater in the last part of the movie was SO LOUD. Didn’t care for the narration either since mickeys voice was so dweebish and unnatural coming from Robert’s masculine face. The pacing was also weird as hell, I was an hr in and thought it had been 2 hrs. It felt like it never wanted to end. 

Also the director said that mark Ruffalo was not supposed to be Trump, but it rlly felt to me that mark was trying to be trump. Also it’s hard to argue otherwise when marks supporters were big dumb idiots in red hats. I’m sure this movie was filmed completely before the Trump asssasination attempt but the scene where mark gets grazed in the face is also a crazy coincidence. 

Finally, the scene where marks love interest screams at mark ruffalo just made me roll my eyes. I wish I was better with words to elaborate on why lol

Mickey 17,Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' Review Thread,09/03/2025,"One of the highlights of Mickey 17 for me was the unique relationship between Mickey and Nasha. Their loyalty to each other added a lot of depth to the story. I was initially concerned about how Nasha’s character might be portrayed. As a Black woman, she was shown as tough, rebellious, and highly sexualised, traits that can sometimes play into stereotypes seen in media.

When Kai came into the picture, I thought the story might take a more predictable turn. I worried that Mickey would leave Nasha for Kai, leading to a deeper connection with her while keeping Nasha as just a sexual partner. But I was pleasantly surprised when that didn’t happen.

The film made it clear that Mickey and Nasha’s relationship wasn’t just about sex. Nasha was there for Mickey through the good and the bad, loving each version of him, and Mickey always looked forward to coming home to her. Nasha also stood up for her place in his life, showing how much their bond mattered.

What I liked most was how this relationship didn’t follow typical Hollywood romance tropes. It felt real and honest, showing the ups and downs of love. Bong Joon Ho is great at this he often shows relationships in a raw and realistic way, and Mickey 17 was no exception.",nikitaloss,1

You have a director that has been given carte blanche ability here, and its quite nice to see in terms of seeing a director seeing their vision through. You have Robert Pattinson having a ball here, playing these different personalities and just having fun while doing so. You get a sense this was a movie that had to be carried by a good performer, and the good thing is Pattinson takes the mantle and runs with it. The world and the sociopolitical commentary here is nice too. There’s tons of subjects being touched upon (being an expendable person in the workforce, the ethics of cloning and their rights, the idea of colonization in a foreign area, etc). Its commendable that a director decided to focus on these things within a big budget sci-fi film, when he could’ve easily played things safe. But, I feel like we get a ton of things that just feel mashed together and being brought forward in a diluted and tonally changing film. The tone is surprisingly goofy at times, and though there are serious things being hinted at and talked about, I feel the over the top tone kinda took me out of the film. Its satire, but I just felt the sci-fi nature of the story clashed with the satire at moments. Overall, Mickey 17 is one of those films that will be liked by the majority, but will cause a deviation in how much one person liked it in comparison to the other. I respect films like this though! They dare to push the envelope on the traditional big budget film, and I sincerely hope it does well because that way, it will give the green light to studios to allow directors to explore more themes and ideas in their big movies (rather than just sticking to generic commentary and tropes).",ViewsOfCinema,1

Certainly not the vibe I got from the book.

It felt like he got the advice to be an “American Everyman” and ended up flat.

Based on the book, they also added a lot of elements that were more Bong’s style. I thought I saw a reference to Parasite in one of the house shots on Earth.

Mickey 17,Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' Review Thread,14/03/2025,"Mickey 17 Spoiler Review

Saw Mickey 17 last weekend. Was very intrigued by the premise and the trailer also hooked me in.

I've seen that as long as I stuck to how 17 & 18 were dealing with the multiples issue, the film kept me engaged. The subplot of the creepers was derailing the end. And it when did end, it became a story of a hero who save and alien species rather than being the character study of someone who has no one to fall back to and is treated as an ""expendable"".

Robert Pattinson was great in his dual roles, and I was also impresed by both the ladies. 

Mark Ruffalo was trying to hard to be like Donald Trump and so was Toni Collette. It's a shame to think that all his despicable acts are quite plausible given the nature of who they both were basing their characters off of.

It was a good time at the movies, but it could easily have trimmed of 15-20 mins. of its runtime to make it more engaging.

8/10 from me.",savagerandy2024,1

Going in, I remembered the feeling I had when I first saw the trailer with “ain’t that a kick in the head” playing - don’t expect a super serious, life-changing movie to teach you something. Rather, it’s going to explore the absurdity & selfish stupidity humanity would bring to the future: through the story about this pleb who voluntarily keeps dying in extreme ways. (I would imagine parasite has a more serious tone)",haw35ome,1
Mickey 17,Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' Review Thread,29/03/2025,"I liked the story but didn't like how it was presented. The in medias res then exposition dump catch up, then another flash back explaining history of doubles. I would have preferred a more start, middle, end without so much voice over and less explaining world building and more showing/inferring. The ending, too, seemed kinda anticlimatic and jumbled. Mickey 18's sacrifice was unsurprising, and the button analogy was fruitless.

There felt like alot of nods to real life social issues: climate change, maga, immigration,oxy cotton, and covid, which will make the movie feel very dated in 5 ,10 years' time. I wished the clone/ mind body problem was explored a little more. The whole different personalities thing but all the same person would have been interesting. Like the homeless guy killer, they were all psychopaths but what if they were turned in by a 4th clone who was a nice guy. Sometimes, I feel like different people based on mood, if I'm hungry, what music I'm listening to, etc, and I would hate to be characterized as a single one of these people. I think we all contain multitudes and would like to have seen that idea explored further. 

The editing and blocking didn't seem as creative as usual bong movie. I liked the Zoom shot of the crowd where mickey 18 emerges with a gun and the design of the creepers. Felt ghibl- esc.  But other than that, nothing stood out for cinematic techniques to me, which is usually my favorite part of Bong movies. The score was pretty but sometimes kinda inappropriate. Awkward fades to blacks and editing, like when he rejects the other girl, kai, I think was her name. 

Also, the flubbing of a few lines was weird. Toni colletes man/human kind was the most agrigious, but the science guy had a few too. I wonder if this was a translation thing that Bong missed not being fluent in English or a tonal thing, making these characters appear dumb but either way,it didn't quite work. Also, the Kai actress going in and out of her accent and her line delivery were really bad acting. Reminded me of early ana de armas roles (hands of stone, war dogs). 

Overall, it was a messy movie, but Pattinson and ruffalo were phenomenal. Philosophical questions of identity and morality are well explored and probably my favorite thing about this film but not totally fleshed out. I'm guessing Bong will go back to another Korean language drama next. If so, I hope he does something in the mystery genre, like memories of murder instead of the family drama of mother or parasite. Truthfully, I hope he swings for the fences one more time with an English language sci-fi film again, even though this one wasn't a homerun.

This and more tell you why this movie got greenlit at all. Overlooking this agenda, the movie is still one of the worst scifi features in history.

The PACING is a-r-d-u-o-u-s. A 2:17 tale that could have been told in a half hour less, but we get to listen to the constant self-deprecation of the MAIN CHARACTER! From William Goldman on, every decent screen writer (or even novelist) knows that your lead character MUST BE LIKEABLE. You want to just shoot this guy and put him out of his misery the first time you see him. And endlessly thereafter.

The ALIENS were basically giant ""rollie-pollies"" that were somehow ""highly intelligent"" even though they lived and operated like insects (which were still more likeable than Mickey).

The DIALOGUE between characters was as infantile as the worst fan fiction you've ever read. ""What's it like to die?"" was the oft-repeated quiz by minor characters and probably the most profound point of this otherwise pointless film. YET THE CHARACTER NEVER REALLY ANSWERS IT!!

Memories of Murder made me have to take a walk and contemplate life. The Host had me literally standing up and cheering at the end watching it in my own home. As I saw another commenter say, it is not BJH’s best, but his worst is still far better than most movies. I feel like this is his most mass appeal movie. It lightly touches on many of BJH’s social commentary themes but doesn’t delve too deep into any of them. I think that’s by design, and I think it’s fine, but it also muddies the waters. I think it would have been better if it were simpler, and specifically I mean the subplot with the Creepers. I didn’t expect the movie to lean so hard into that, it felt out of nowhere. I felt like the first half of the movie was leaning into ‘the working class is literally seen as expendable by the rich’ and the second half was anticolonial/‘we’re the aliens!!!/Okja 2.0.

Mickey 17,Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17' Review Thread,16/02/2025,"I would definitely not say Parasite is heavy handed. While it's clearly about class welfare, it has a lot of nuance and subtlety even if it has a few bombastic moments. Most general audience people who watch Parasite came away enjoying it because it was entertaining and twisted, they didn't really care about the message or pick up on it fully. The film works for everyone (like Everything Everywhere All At Once) because the film is effortlessly entertaining. That means that general audience can enjoy the film without putting in any effort to parse it's meaning and walk away with an enjoyable and entertaining experience. At the same time, cinephiles who need more depth were able to watch the same film an walk away satisfied by its layers and narrative structure. The film appeals to both demographics, but the vast majority of people who watch the film watch it like a blockbuster / horror film and not as some political statement piece. And determining who misunderstood the film is as easy as asking, ""Who is the bad guy in Parasite? Who is the good guy?"" And watching the array of answers that come out. 


Films with similar appeal would include:

Everything Everywhere All At Once

Taxi Driver 

Whiplash

The Matrix

All of which, while have moments lacking subtlety, have a whole lot of subtlety and nuance overall layered in the film if you put in the effort to look for it. And otherwise are enjoyable regardless of if you want to put in effort or not.",valkrycp,50

From the central gimmick I was expecting to at least get a bit of existential musing, but all we really get on that front is “death doesn’t feel great”. This shallowness is the only consistent element throughout the whole thing. 

There’s a political aspect there as well, but that too feels underdeveloped and cartoonish. So it’s way too shallow to work as philosophical sci-fi or social critique, and not nearly funny enough to stand on its comedy alone. 

Add to that a plot that’s so scattered and disjointed that none of the angles really amount to much. (The entire resolution with the creatures just felt like a rushed synopsis of *Arrival*, if it had been produced by Disney.)

In fact, I’d argue that the singular appeal of Bong’s films is rooted in the seemingly infinite spectrum of shiv-like slapstick they’re able to mine from the obviousness of the same basic subject; I’d argue that his films use the screaming moral iniquities of capitalism as a kind of centrifugal force that allows them to spin in several directions at once — and slush any number of different tones into a madcap genre all their own — without ever flying off the handle.",SEND-MARS-ROVER-PICS,8

Then they had the reboot, released in 2013 that everyone calls Mickey '13. The problem is then they did a sequel to Mickey XII called Mickey XIII, but the reboot franchise wanted to differentiate itself from the porn parody franchise, so they kept their naming scheme with the name of the year. The next one to come out was Mickey '15, and it was supposed to have a sequel with Brad Pitt two years later, but it ended up getting delayed and then of course, covid happened so it stayed in development hell. They wanted to be clear it was the sequel to Mickey '15 though, and they had already built hype, so they kept the name Mickey 17

So really all you need is Mickey 13 (not Mickey XIII), Mickey 15, and then the knowledge that Mickey 17 was written to take place two years after Mickey 15.",sonofaresiii,4

Ideas were not given time or focus to fully materialize, and those which did burnt too fast and too quick.

Mickey 17,New Posters for Bong Joon-ho's 'Mickey 17',24/01/2025,"I'm a journalist who, for part of my job, writes about the advertising industry.

It's unlikely to be the same exact person, but possibly the same advertising/creative agency and possibly the same team.

Both movies are being distributed in the U.S. by Warner Bros. Pictures, which relies on a combination of several in-house and external creative agencies for its film hype campaigns, sometimes assigned on a film-by-film basis, or by project: e.g., one team will be assigned the poster design, another will handle trailers, another will launch an experiential activation in New York City, another will handle PR. But it's not always the same team doing each, and in many cases they don't even work for the same company, or the same affiliate of the same company.

Film studios often don't allow agencies to promote all of the work they did on a project, but if it's not an in-house creative group, then it's probably one of the bigger agencies they work with or a subsidiary. They've worked with agencies including Dentsu and GroupM.",articulateantagonist,187

Still excited for the movie because it was an interesting concept and I probably would have enjoyed it if a different author wrote it. But the book was full of unnecessary exposition, world building was pretty inconsistent, and characters were really not believable in the slightest. And there’s a particular thing that happens near the end right after Mickey’s secret comes out that I won’t share because spoilers, but it was so laughably bad.

Company B does secondary designs for other purposes or we provide them with our working files to use for some other thing 

Company C provides the content / imagery / copywriting

Company D handles distribution
